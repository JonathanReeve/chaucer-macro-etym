OUR Hoste gan to swear as he were wood;
"Harow!" quoth he, "by nailes and by blood, <1>
This was a cursed thief, a false justice.
As shameful death as hearte can devise
Come to these judges and their advoca's.*        *advocates, counsellors
Algate* this sely** maid is slain, alas!        *nevertheless **innocent
Alas! too deare bought she her beauty.
Wherefore I say, that all day man may see
That giftes of fortune and of nature
Be cause of death to many a creature.
Her beauty was her death, I dare well sayn;
Alas! so piteously as she was slain.
[Of bothe giftes, that I speak of now
Men have full often more harm than prow,*]                       *profit
But truely, mine owen master dear,
This was a piteous tale for to hear;
But natheless, pass over; 'tis *no force.*                   *no matter*
I pray to God to save thy gentle corse,*                           *body
And eke thine urinals, and thy jordans,
Thine Hippocras, and eke thy Galliens, <2>
And every boist* full of thy lectuary,                          *box <3>
God bless them, and our lady Sainte Mary.
So may I the',* thou art a proper man,                           *thrive
And like a prelate, by Saint Ronian;
Said I not well? Can I not speak *in term?*                *in set form*
But well I wot thou dost* mine heart to erme,**      *makest **grieve<4>
That I have almost caught a cardiacle:*                   *heartache <5>
By corpus Domini <6>, but* I have triacle,**          *unless **a remedy
Or else a draught of moist and corny <7> ale,
Or but* I hear anon a merry tale,                                *unless
Mine heart is brost* for pity of this maid.               *burst, broken
Thou *bel ami,*  thou Pardoner," he said,                  *good friend*
"Tell us some mirth of japes* right anon."                        *jokes
"It shall be done," quoth he, "by Saint Ronion.
But first," quoth he, "here at this ale-stake*       *ale-house sign <8>
I will both drink, and biten on a cake."
But right anon the gentles gan to cry,
"Nay, let him tell us of no ribaldry.
Tell us some moral thing, that we may lear*                       *learn
Some wit,* and thenne will we gladly hear."               *wisdom, sense
"I grant y-wis,"* quoth he; "but I must think                    *surely
Upon some honest thing while that I drink."
