The First Fit*                                                     *part

Listen, lordings, in good intent,
And I will tell you verrament*                                    *truly
Of mirth and of solas,*                                 *delight, solace
All of a knight was fair and gent,*                              *gentle
In battle and in tournament,
His name was Sir Thopas.

Y-born he was in far country,
In Flanders, all beyond the sea,
At Popering <2> in the place;
His father was a man full free,
And lord he was of that country,
As it was Godde's grace. <3>

Sir Thopas was a doughty swain,
White was his face as paindemain, <4>
His lippes red as rose.
His rode* is like scarlet in grain,                          *complexion
And I you tell in good certain
He had a seemly nose.

His hair, his beard, was like saffroun,
That to his girdle reach'd adown,
His shoes of cordewane:<5>
Of Bruges were his hosen brown;
His robe was of ciclatoun,<6>
That coste many a jane.<7>

He coulde hunt at the wild deer,
And ride on hawking *for rivere*                          *by the river*
With gray goshawk on hand: <8>
Thereto he was a good archere,
Of wrestling was there none his peer,
Where any ram <9> should stand.

Full many a maiden bright in bow'r
They mourned for him par amour,
When them were better sleep;
But he was chaste, and no lechour,
And sweet as is the bramble flow'r
That beareth the red heep.*                                         *hip

And so it fell upon a day,
For sooth as I you telle may,
Sir Thopas would out ride;
He worth* upon his steede gray,                                 *mounted
And in his hand a launcegay,*                                *spear <10>
A long sword by his side.

He pricked through a fair forest,
Wherein is many a wilde beast,
Yea, bothe buck and hare;
And as he pricked north and east,
I tell it you, him had almest                                    *almost
Betid* a sorry care.                                           *befallen

There sprange herbes great and small,
The liquorice and the setewall,*                               *valerian
And many a clove-gilofre, <12>
And nutemeg to put in ale,
Whether it be moist* or stale,                                      *new
Or for to lay in coffer.

The birdes sang, it is no nay,
The sperhawk* and the popinjay,**             *sparrowhawk **parrot <13>
That joy it was to hear;
The throstle-cock made eke his lay,
The woode-dove upon the spray
She sang full loud and clear.

Sir Thopas fell in love-longing
All when he heard the throstle sing,
And *prick'd as he were wood;*                            *rode as if he
His faire steed in his pricking                                were mad*
So sweated, that men might him wring,
His sides were all blood.

Sir Thopas eke so weary was
For pricking on the softe grass,
So fierce was his corage,*                          *inclination, spirit
That down he laid him in that place,
To make his steed some solace,
And gave him good forage.

"Ah, Saint Mary, ben'dicite,
What aileth thilke* love at me                                     *this
To binde me so sore?
Me dreamed all this night, pardie,
An elf-queen shall my leman* be,                               *mistress
And sleep under my gore.*                                         *shirt

An elf-queen will I love, y-wis,*                             *assuredly
For in this world no woman is
Worthy to be my make*                                              *mate
In town;
All other women I forsake,
And to an elf-queen I me take
By dale and eke by down." <14>

Into his saddle he clomb anon,
And pricked over stile and stone
An elf-queen for to spy,
Till he so long had ridden and gone,
That he found in a privy wonne*                                   *haunt
The country of Faery,
So wild;
For in that country was there none
That to him durste ride or gon,
Neither wife nor child.

Till that there came a great giaunt,
His name was Sir Oliphaunt,<15>
A perilous man of deed;
He saide, "Child,* by Termagaunt, <16>                        *young man
*But if* thou prick out of mine haunt,                           *unless
Anon I slay thy steed
With mace.
Here is the Queen of Faery,
With harp, and pipe, and symphony,
Dwelling in this place."

The Child said, "All so may I the,*                              *thrive
To-morrow will I meete thee,
When I have mine armor;
And yet I hope, *par ma fay,*                              *by my faith*
That thou shalt with this launcegay
Abyen* it full sore;                                         *suffer for
Thy maw*                                                          *belly
Shall I pierce, if I may,
Ere it be fully prime of day,
For here thou shalt be slaw."*                                    *slain

Sir Thopas drew aback full fast;
This giant at him stones cast
Out of a fell staff sling:
But fair escaped Child Thopas,
And all it was through Godde's grace,
And through his fair bearing. <17>

Yet listen, lordings, to my tale,
Merrier than the nightingale,
For now I will you rown,*                                       *whisper
How Sir Thopas, with sides smale,*                           *small <18>
Pricking over hill and dale,
Is come again to town.

His merry men commanded he
To make him both game and glee;
For needes must he fight
With a giant with heades three,
For paramour and jollity
Of one that shone full bright.

"*Do come,*" he saide, "my minstrales                           *summon*
And gestours* for to telle tales.                         *story-tellers
Anon in mine arming,
Of romances that be royales, <19>
Of popes and of cardinales,
And eke of love-longing."

They fetch'd him first the sweete wine,
And mead eke in a maseline,*                              *drinking-bowl
And royal spicery;                                    of maple wood <20>
Of ginger-bread that was full fine,
And liquorice and eke cumin,
With sugar that is trie.*                                       *refined

He didde,* next his white lere,**                         *put on **skin
Of cloth of lake* fine and clear,                            *fine linen
A breech and eke a shirt;
And next his shirt an haketon,*                                 *cassock
And over that an habergeon,*                               *coat of mail
For piercing of his heart;

And over that a fine hauberk,*                             *plate-armour
Was all y-wrought of Jewes'* werk,                           *magicians'
Full strong it was of plate;
And over that his coat-armour,*                        *knight's surcoat
As white as is the lily flow'r, <21>
In which he would debate.*                                        *fight

His shield was all of gold so red
And therein was a boare's head,
A charboucle* beside;                                    *carbuncle <22>
And there he swore on ale and bread,
How that the giant should be dead,
Betide whatso betide.

His jambeaux* were of cuirbouly, <23>                             *boots
His sworde's sheath of ivory,
His helm of latoun* bright,                                       *brass
His saddle was of rewel <24> bone,
His bridle as the sunne shone,
Or as the moonelight.

His speare was of fine cypress,
That bodeth war, and nothing peace;
The head full sharp y-ground.
His steede was all dapple gray,
It went an amble in the way
Full softely and round
In land.

Lo, Lordes mine, here is a fytt;
If ye will any more of it,
To tell it will I fand.*                                            *try


The Second Fit


Now hold your mouth for charity,
Bothe knight and lady free,
And hearken to my spell;*                                     *tale <25>
Of battle and of chivalry,
Of ladies' love and druerie,*                                 *gallantry
Anon I will you tell.

Men speak of romances of price*                          * worth, esteem
Of Horn Child, and of Ipotis,
Of Bevis, and Sir Guy, <26>
Of Sir Libeux, <27> and Pleindamour,
But Sir Thopas, he bears the flow'r
Of royal chivalry.

His goode steed he all bestrode,
And forth upon his way he glode,*                                 *shone
As sparkle out of brand;*                                         *torch
Upon his crest he bare a tow'r,
And therein stick'd a lily flow'r; <28>
God shield his corse* from shand!**                         *body **harm

And, for he was a knight auntrous,*                         *adventurous
He woulde sleepen in none house,
But liggen* in his hood,                                            *lie
His brighte helm was his wanger,*                           *pillow <29>
And by him baited* his destrer**                       *fed **horse <30>
Of herbes fine and good.

Himself drank water of the well,
As did the knight Sir Percivel, <31>
So worthy under weed;
Till on a day -   .   .   .
