A prentice whilom dwelt in our city,
And of a craft of victuallers was he:
Galliard* he was, as goldfinch in the shaw**,            *lively **grove
Brown as a berry, a proper short fellaw:
With lockes black, combed full fetisly.*                       *daintily
And dance he could so well and jollily,
That he was called Perkin Revellour.
He was as full of love and paramour,
As is the honeycomb of honey sweet;
Well was the wenche that with him might meet.
At every bridal would he sing and hop;
He better lov'd the tavern than the shop.
For when there any riding was in Cheap,<1>
Out of the shoppe thither would he leap,
And, till that he had all the sight y-seen,
And danced well, he would not come again;
And gather'd him a meinie* of his sort,              *company of fellows
To hop and sing, and make such disport:
And there they *sette steven* for to meet             *made appointment*
To playen at the dice in such a street.
For in the towne was there no prentice
That fairer coulde cast a pair of dice
Than Perkin could; and thereto *he was free    *he spent money liberally
Of his dispence, in place of privity.*       where he would not be seen*
That found his master well in his chaffare,*                *merchandise
For oftentime he found his box full bare.
For, soothely, a prentice revellour,
That haunteth dice, riot, and paramour,
His master shall it in his shop abie*,                       *suffer for
All* have he no part of the minstrelsy.                        *although
For theft and riot they be convertible,
All can they play on *gitern or ribible.*             *guitar or rebeck*
Revel and truth, as in a low degree,
They be full wroth* all day, as men may see.                *at variance

This jolly prentice with his master bode,
Till he was nigh out of his prenticehood,
All were he snubbed* both early and late,                       *rebuked
And sometimes led with revel to Newgate.
But at the last his master him bethought,
Upon a day when he his paper<2> sought,
Of a proverb, that saith this same word;
Better is rotten apple out of hoard,
Than that it should rot all the remenant:
So fares it by a riotous servant;
It is well lesse harm to let him pace*,                        *pass, go
Than he shend* all the servants in the place.                   *corrupt
Therefore his master gave him a quittance,
And bade him go, with sorrow and mischance.
And thus this jolly prentice had his leve*:                      *desire
Now let him riot all the night, or leave*.                      *refrain
And, for there is no thief without a louke,<3>
That helpeth him to wasten and to souk*                           *spend
Of that he bribe* can, or borrow may,                             *steal
Anon he sent his bed and his array
Unto a compere* of his owen sort,                               *comrade
That loved dice, and riot, and disport;
And had a wife, that held *for countenance*            *for appearances*
A shop, and swived* for her sustenance.             *prostituted herself
