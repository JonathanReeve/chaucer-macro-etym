WHEN said was this miracle, every man
As sober* was, that wonder was to see,                          *serious
Till that our Host to japen* he began,                     *talk lightly
And then *at erst* he looked upon me,               *for the first time*
And saide thus; "What man art thou?" quoth he;
"Thou lookest as thou wouldest find an hare,
For ever on the ground I see thee stare.

"Approache near, and look up merrily.
Now ware you, Sirs, and let this man have place.
He in the waist is shapen as well as I; <2>
This were a puppet in an arm t'embrace
For any woman small and fair of face.
He seemeth elvish* by his countenance,                    *surly, morose
For unto no wight doth he dalliance.

"Say now somewhat, since other folk have said;
Tell us a tale of mirth, and that anon."
"Hoste," quoth I, "be not evil apaid,*                     *dissatisfied
For other tale certes can* I none,                                 *know
Eut of a rhyme I learned yore* agone."                             *long
"Yea, that is good," quoth he; "now shall we hear
Some dainty thing, me thinketh by thy cheer."*         *expression, mien
