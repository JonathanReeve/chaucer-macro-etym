WHEN folk had laughed all at this nice case
Of Absolon and Hendy Nicholas,
Diverse folk diversely they said,
But for the more part they laugh'd and play'd;*           *were diverted
And at this tale I saw no man him grieve,
But it were only Osewold the Reeve.
Because he was of carpenteres craft,
A little ire is in his hearte laft*;                               *left
He gan to grudge* and blamed it a lite.**              *murmur **little.
"So the* I,"  quoth he, "full well could I him quite**   *thrive **match
With blearing* of a proude miller's eye,                    *dimming <1>
If that me list to speak of ribaldry.
But I am old; me list not play for age; <2>
Grass time is done, my fodder is now forage.
This white top* writeth mine olde years;                           *head
Mine heart is also moulded* as mine hairs;                 *grown mouldy
And I do fare as doth an open-erse*;                         *medlar <3>
That ilke* fruit is ever longer werse,                             *same
Till it be rotten *in mullok or in stre*.    *on the ground or in straw*
We olde men, I dread, so fare we;
Till we be rotten, can we not be ripe;
We hop* away, while that the world will pipe;                     *dance
For in our will there sticketh aye a nail,
To have an hoary head and a green tail,
As hath a leek; for though our might be gone,
Our will desireth folly ever-in-one*:                       *continually
For when we may not do, then will we speak,
Yet in our ashes cold does fire reek.*                         *smoke<4>
Four gledes* have we, which I shall devise**,         *coals ** describe
Vaunting, and lying, anger, covetise*.                     *covetousness
These foure sparks belongen unto eld.
Our olde limbes well may be unweld*,                           *unwieldy
But will shall never fail us, that is sooth.
And yet have I alway a coltes tooth,<5>
As many a year as it is passed and gone
Since that my tap of life began to run;
For sickerly*, when I was born, anon                          *certainly
Death drew the tap of life, and let it gon:
And ever since hath so the tap y-run,
Till that almost all empty is the tun.
The stream of life now droppeth on the chimb.<6>
The silly tongue well may ring and chime
Of wretchedness, that passed is full yore*:                        *long
With olde folk, save dotage, is no more. <7>

When that our Host had heard this sermoning,
He gan to speak as lordly as a king,
And said; "To what amounteth all this wit?
What? shall we speak all day of holy writ?
The devil made a Reeve for to preach,
As of a souter* a shipman, or a leach**.                    *cobbler <8>
Say forth thy tale, and tarry not the time:                **surgeon <9>
Lo here is Deptford, and 'tis half past prime:<10>
Lo Greenwich, where many a shrew is in.
It were high time thy tale to begin."

"Now, sirs," quoth then this Osewold the Reeve,
I pray you all that none of you do grieve,
Though I answer, and somewhat set his hove*,                  *hood <11>
For lawful is *force off with force to shove.*           *to repel force
This drunken miller hath y-told us here                        by force*
How that beguiled was a carpentere,
Paraventure* in scorn, for I am one:                            *perhaps
And, by your leave, I shall him quite anon.
Right in his churlish termes will I speak,
I pray to God his necke might to-break.
He can well in mine eye see a stalk,
But in his own he cannot see a balk."<12>
