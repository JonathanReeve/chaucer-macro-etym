"No more of this, for Godde's dignity!"
Quoth oure Hoste; "for thou makest me
So weary of thy very lewedness,*               *stupidity, ignorance <1>
That, all so wisly* God my soule bless,                          *surely
Mine eares ache for thy drafty* speech.                   *worthless <2>
Now such a rhyme the devil I beteche:*                       *commend to
This may well be rhyme doggerel," quoth he.
"Why so?" quoth I; "why wilt thou lette* me                     *prevent
More of my tale than any other man,
Since that it is the best rhyme that I can?"*                      *know
"By God!" quoth he, "for, plainly at one word,
Thy drafty rhyming is not worth a tord:
Thou dost naught elles but dispendest* time.                    *wastest
Sir, at one word, thou shalt no longer rhyme.
Let see whether thou canst tellen aught *in gest,*            *by way of
Or tell in prose somewhat, at the least,                      narrative*
In which there be some mirth or some doctrine."
"Gladly," quoth I, "by Godde's sweete pine,*                  *suffering
I will you tell a little thing in prose,
That oughte like* you, as I suppose,                             *please
Or else certes ye be too dangerous.*                         *fastidious
It is a moral tale virtuous,
*All be it* told sometimes in sundry wise               *although it be*
By sundry folk, as I shall you devise.
As thus, ye wot that ev'ry Evangelist,
That telleth us the pain* of Jesus Christ,                      *passion
He saith not all thing as his fellow doth;
But natheless their sentence is all soth,*                         *true
And all accorden as in their sentence,*                         *meaning
All be there in their telling difference;
For some of them say more, and some say less,
When they his piteous passion express;
I mean of Mark and Matthew, Luke and John;
But doubteless their sentence is all one.
Therefore, lordinges all, I you beseech,
If that ye think I vary in my speech,
As thus, though that I telle somedeal more
Of proverbes, than ye have heard before
Comprehended in this little treatise here,
*T'enforce with* the effect of my mattere,                *with which to
And though I not the same wordes say                            enforce*
As ye have heard, yet to you all I pray
Blame me not; for as in my sentence
Shall ye nowhere finde no difference
From the sentence of thilke* treatise lite,**             *this **little
After the which this merry tale I write.
And therefore hearken to what I shall say,
And let me tellen all my tale, I pray."
