"HEY! Godde's mercy!" said our Hoste tho,*                         *then
"Now such a wife I pray God keep me fro'.
Lo, suche sleightes and subtilities
In women be; for aye as busy as bees
Are they us silly men for to deceive,
And from the soothe* will they ever weive,**     *truth **swerve, depart
As this Merchante's tale it proveth well.
But natheless, as true as any steel,
I have a wife, though that she poore be;
But of her tongue a labbing* shrew is she;                   *chattering
And yet* she hath a heap of vices mo'.                         *moreover
Thereof *no force;* let all such thinges go.                 *no matter*
But wit* ye what? in counsel** be it said,    *know **secret, confidence
Me rueth sore I am unto her tied;
For, an'* I shoulde reckon every vice                                *if
Which that she hath, y-wis* I were too nice;**      *certainly **foolish
And cause why, it should reported be
And told her by some of this company
(By whom, it needeth not for to declare,
Since women connen utter such chaffare <1>),
And eke my wit sufficeth not thereto
To tellen all; wherefore my tale is do.*                           *done
Squier, come near, if it your wille be,
And say somewhat of love, for certes ye
*Conne thereon* as much as any man."                     *know about it*
"Nay, Sir," quoth he; "but such thing as I can,
With hearty will, -- for I will not rebel
Against your lust,* -- a tale will I tell.                     *pleasure
Have me excused if I speak amiss;
My will is good; and lo, my tale is this."
