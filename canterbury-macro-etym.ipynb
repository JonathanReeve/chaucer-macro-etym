And thereout came a rage and such a vise, That it made all the gates for to rise. The northern light in at the doore shone, For window on the walle was there none Through which men mighten any light discern. The doors were all of adamant etern, Y-clenched overthwart and ende-long With iron tough, and, for to make it strong, Every pillar the temple to sustain Was tunne-great, of iron bright and sheen. There saw I first the dark imagining Of felony, and all the compassing; The cruel ire, as red as any glede, The picke-purse, and eke the pale dread; The smiler with the knife under the cloak, The shepen burning with the blacke smoke The treason of the murd'ring in the bed, The open war, with woundes all be-bled; Conteke with bloody knife, and sharp menace. All full of chirking was that sorry place.

And all above depainted in a tower Saw I Conquest, sitting in great honour, With thilke sharpe sword over his head Hanging by a subtle y-twined thread. Painted the slaughter was of Julius, Of cruel Nero, and Antonius: Although at that time they were yet unborn, Yet was their death depainted there beforn, By menacing of Mars, right by figure, So was it showed in that portraiture, As is depainted in the stars above, Who shall be slain, or elles dead for love.

And to the grove, of which I have you told, By a venture his way began to hold, To make him a garland of the greves, Were it of woodbine, or of hawthorn leaves, And loud he sang against the sun so sheen. \"O May, with all thy flowers and thy green, Right welcome be thou, faire freshe May, I hope that I some green here getten may.\" And from his courser, with a lusty heart, Into the grove full hastily he start, And in a path he roamed up and down, There as by aventure this Palamon Was in a bush, that no man might him see, For sore afeard of his death was he. Nothing ne knew he that it was Arcite; God wot he would have trowed it full lite.

For, when she saw the Romans win the town, She took her children all, and skipt adown Into the fire, and rather chose to die, Than any Roman did her villainy. Hath not Lucretia slain herself, alas! At Rome, when that she oppressed was Of Tarquin? for her thought it was a shame To live, when she hadde lost her name.

This noble ensample to his sheep he gaf, That first he wrought, and afterward he taught. Out of the gospel he the wordes caught, And this figure he added yet thereto, That if gold ruste, what should iron do? For if a priest be foul, on whom we trust, No wonder is a lewed man to rust: And shame it is, if that a priest take keep, To see a shitten shepherd and clean sheep: Well ought a priest ensample for to give, By his own cleanness, how his sheep should live. He sette not his benefice to hire, And left his sheep eucumber'd in the mire, And ran unto London, unto Saint Paul's, To seeke him a chantery for souls, Or with a brotherhood to be withold: But dwelt at home, and kepte well his fold, So that the wolf ne made it not miscarry. He was a shepherd, and no mercenary. And though he holy were, and virtuous, He was to sinful men not dispitous Nor of his speeche dangerous nor dign But in his teaching discreet and benign. To drawen folk to heaven, with fairness, By good ensample, was his business: But it were any person obstinate, What so he were of high or low estate, Him would he snibbe sharply for the nones. A better priest I trow that nowhere none is. He waited after no pomp nor reverence, Nor maked him a spiced conscience, But Christe's lore, and his apostles' twelve, He taught, and first he follow'd it himselve.\"),\n",

Honour is also called great dignity and highness; but in hell shall they be all fortrodden [trampled under foot] of devils. As God saith, \"The horrible devils shall go and come upon the heads of damned folk;\" and this is, forasmuch as the higher that they were in this present life, the more shall they be abated [abased] and defouled in hell. Against the riches of this world shall they have misease [trouble, torment] of poverty, and this poverty shall be in four things: in default [want] of treasure; of which David saith, \"The rich folk that embraced and oned [united] all their heart to treasure of this world, shall sleep in the sleeping of death, and nothing shall they find in their hands of all their treasure.\" And moreover, the misease of hell shall be in default of meat and drink. For God saith thus by Moses, \"They shall be wasted with hunger, and the birds of hell shall devour them with bitter death, and the gall of the dragon shall be their drink, and the venom of the dragon their morsels.\" And furthermore, their misease shall be in default of clothing, for they shall be naked in body, as of clothing, save the fire in which they burn, and other filths; and naked shall they be in soul, of all manner virtues, which that is the clothing of the soul. Where be then the gay robes, and the soft sheets, and the fine shirts? Lo, what saith of them the prophet Isaiah, that under them shall be strewed moths, and their covertures shall be of worms of hell. And furthermore, their misease shall be in default of friends, for he is not poor that hath good friends: but there is no friend; for neither God nor any good creature shall be friend to them, and evereach of them shall hate other with deadly hate. The Sons and the daughters shall rebel against father and mother, and kindred against kindred, and chide and despise each other, both day and night, as God saith by the prophet Micah. And the loving children, that whom loved so fleshly each other, would each of them eat the other if they might. For how should they love together in the pains of hell, when they hated each other in the prosperity of this life? For trust well, their fleshly love was deadly hate; as saith the prophet David; \"Whoso loveth wickedness, he hateth his own soul:\" and whoso hateth his own soul, certes he may love none other wight in no manner: and therefore in hell is no solace nor no friendship, but ever the more kindreds that be in hell, the more cursing, the more chiding, and the more deadly hate there is among them. And furtherover, they shall have default of all manner delights; for certes delights be after the appetites of the five wits [senses]; as sight, hearing, smelling, savouring [tasting], and touching. But in hell their sight shall be full of darkness and of smoke, and their eyes full of tears; and their hearing full of waimenting [lamenting] and grinting [gnashing] of teeth, as saith Jesus Christ; their nostrils shall be full of stinking; and, as saith Isaiah the prophet, their savouring bitter gall; and touching of all their body shall be covered with fire that never shall quench, and with worms that never shall die, as God saith by the mouth of Isaiah. And forasmuch as they shall not ween that they may die for pain, and by death flee from pain, that may they understand in the word of Job, that saith, \"There is the shadow of death.\" Certes a shadow hath the likeness of the thing of which it is shadowed, but the shadow is not the same thing of which it is shadowed: right so fareth the pain of hell; it is like death, for the horrible anguish; and why? for it paineth them ever as though they should die anon; but certes they shall not die. For, as saith Saint Gregory, \"To wretched caitiffs shall be given death without death, and end without end, and default without failing; for their death shall always live, and their end shall evermore begin, and their default shall never fail.\" And therefore saith Saint John the Evangelist, \"They shall follow death, and they shall not find him, and they shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.\" And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath created all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order. For the earth shall bear them no fruit (for, as the prophet David saith, \"God shall destroy the fruit of the earth, as for them\"); nor water shall give them no moisture, nor the air no refreshing, nor the fire no light. For as saith Saint Basil, \"The burning of world shall God give in hell to them that be damned, but the light and the clearness shall be given in heaven to his children; right as the good man giveth flesh to his children, and bones to his hounds.\" And for they shall have no hope to escape, saith Job at last, that there shall horror and grisly dread dwell without end. Horror is always dread of harm that is to come, and this dread shall ever dwell in the hearts of them that be damned. And therefore have they lost all their hope for seven causes. First, for God that is their judge shall be without mercy to them; nor they may not please him; nor none of his hallows [saints]; nor they may give nothing for their ransom; nor they have no voice to speak to him; nor they may not flee from pain; nor they have no goodness in them that they may shew to deliver them from pain.'),\n",

With danger utter we all our chaffare; Great press at market maketh deare ware, And too great cheap is held at little price; This knoweth every woman that is wise. My fifthe husband, God his soule bless, Which that I took for love and no richess, He some time was a clerk of Oxenford, And had left school, and went at home to board With my gossip, dwelling in oure town: God have her soul, her name was Alisoun. She knew my heart, and all my privity, Bet than our parish priest, so may I the. To her betrayed I my counsel all; For had my husband pissed on a wall, Or done a thing that should have cost his life, To her, and to another worthy wife, And to my niece, which that I loved well, I would have told his counsel every deal. And so I did full often, God it wot, That made his face full often red and hot For very shame, and blam\\'d himself, for he Had told to me so great a privity. And so befell that ones in a Lent (So oftentimes I to my gossip went, For ever yet I loved to be gay, And for to walk in March, April, and May From house to house, to heare sundry tales), That Jenkin clerk, and my gossip, Dame Ales, And I myself, into the fieldes went. Mine husband was at London all that Lent; I had the better leisure for to play, And for to see, and eke for to be sey Of lusty folk; what wist I where my grace Was shapen for to be, or in what place? Therefore made I my visitations To vigilies, and to processions, To preachings eke, and to these pilgrimages, To plays of miracles, and marriages, And weared upon me gay scarlet gites. These wormes, nor these mothes, nor these mites On my apparel frett them never a deal And know\\'st thou why? for they were used well. Now will I telle forth what happen\\'d me: I say, that in the fieldes walked we, Till truely we had such dalliance, This clerk and I, that of my purveyance I spake to him, and told him how that he, If I were widow, shoulde wedde me. For certainly, I say for no bobance, Yet was I never without purveyance Of marriage, nor of other thinges eke: I hold a mouse\\'s wit not worth a leek, That hath but one hole for to starte to, And if that faile, then is all y-do. [I bare him on hand he had enchanted me (My dame taughte me that subtilty); And eke I said, I mette of him all night, He would have slain me, as I lay upright, And all my bed was full of very blood; But yet I hop\\'d that he should do me good; For blood betoken\\'d gold, as me was taught. And all was false, I dream\\'d of him right naught, But as I follow\\'d aye my dame\\'s lore, As well of that as of other things more.]  But now, sir, let me see, what shall I sayn? Aha! by God, I have my tale again. When that my fourthe husband was on bier, I wept algate and made a sorry cheer, As wives must, for it is the usage; And with my kerchief covered my visage; But, for I was provided with a make, I wept but little, that I undertake To churche was mine husband borne a-morrow With neighebours that for him made sorrow, And Jenkin, oure clerk, was one of tho: As help me God, when that I saw him go After the bier, methought he had a pair Of legges and of feet so clean and fair, That all my heart I gave unto his hold. He was, I trow, a twenty winter old, And I was forty, if I shall say sooth, But yet I had always a colte\\'s tooth. Gat-toothed I was, and that became me well, I had the print of Sainte Venus\\' seal. [As help me God, I was a lusty one, And fair, and rich, and young, and well begone: For certes I am all venerian In feeling, and my heart is martian; Venus me gave my lust and liquorishness, And Mars gave me my sturdy hardiness.]  Mine ascendant was Taure, and Mars therein: Alas, alas, that ever love was sin! I follow\\'d aye mine inclination By virtue of my constellation: That made me that I coulde not withdraw My chamber of Venus from a good fellaw. [Yet have I Marte\\'s mark upon my face, And also in another privy place. For God so wisly be my salvation, I loved never by discretion, But ever follow\\'d mine own appetite, All were he short, or long, or black, or white, I took no keep, so that he liked me, How poor he was, neither of what degree.]  What should I say? but that at the month\\'s end This jolly clerk Jenkin, that was so hend, Had wedded me with great solemnity, And to him gave I all the land and fee That ever was me given therebefore: But afterward repented me full sore. He woulde suffer nothing of my list. By God, he smote me ones with his fist, For that I rent out of his book a leaf, That of the stroke mine eare wax\\'d all deaf. Stubborn I was, as is a lioness, And of my tongue a very jangleress, And walk I would, as I had done beforn, From house to house, although he had it sworn: For which he oftentimes woulde preach And me of olde Roman gestes teach How that Sulpitius Gallus left his wife And her forsook for term of all his For nought but open-headed he her say Looking out at his door upon a day. Another Roman  told he me by name, That, for his wife was at a summer game Without his knowing, he forsook her eke. And then would he upon his Bible seek That ilke proverb of Ecclesiast, Where he commandeth, and forbiddeth fast, Man shall not suffer his wife go roll about. Then would he say right thus withoute doubt: \"Whoso that buildeth his house all of sallows, And pricketh his blind horse over the fallows, And suff\\'reth his wife to go seeke hallows, Is worthy to be hanged on the gallows.\" But all for nought; I sette not a haw Of his proverbs, nor of his olde saw; Nor would I not of him corrected be. I hate them that my vices telle me, And so do more of us (God wot) than I. This made him wood with me all utterly; I woulde not forbear him in no case. Now will I say you sooth, by Saint Thomas, Why that I rent out of his book a leaf, For which he smote me, so that I was deaf. He had a book, that gladly night and day For his disport he would it read alway; He call\\'d it Valerie, and Theophrast, And with that book he laugh\\'d alway full fast. And eke there was a clerk sometime at Rome, A cardinal, that highte Saint Jerome, That made a book against Jovinian, Which book was there; and eke Tertullian, Chrysippus, Trotula, and Heloise, That was an abbess not far from Paris; And eke the Parables of Solomon, Ovide\\'s Art,  and bourdes many one; And alle these were bound in one volume. And every night and day was his custume (When he had leisure and vacation From other worldly occupation) To readen in this book of wicked wives. He knew of them more legends and more lives Than be of goodde wives in the Bible. For, trust me well, it is an impossible That any clerk will speake good of wives, (But if it be of holy saintes\\' lives) Nor of none other woman never the mo\\'. Who painted the lion, tell it me, who? By God, if women haddde written stories, As clerkes have within their oratories, They would have writ of men more wickedness Than all the mark of Adam  may redress The children of Mercury and of Venus, Be in their working full contrarious. Mercury loveth wisdom and science, And Venus loveth riot and dispence. And for their diverse disposition, Each falls in other\\'s exaltation. As thus, God wot, Mercury is desolate In Pisces, where Venus is exaltate, And Venus falls where Mercury is raised.  Therefore no woman by no clerk is praised. The clerk, when he is old, and may not do Of Venus\\' works not worth his olde shoe, Then sits he down, and writes in his dotage, That women cannot keep their marriage. But now to purpose, why I tolde thee That I was beaten for a book, pardie.'),\n",

There saw he hartes with their hornes high, The greatest that were ever seen with eye. He saw of them an hundred slain with hounds, And some with arrows bleed of bitter wounds. He saw, when voided were the wilde deer, These falconers upon a fair rivere, That with their hawkes have the heron slain. Then saw he knightes jousting in a plain. And after this he did him such pleasance, That he him shew\\'d his lady on a dance, In which himselfe danced, as him thought. And when this master, that this magic wrought, Saw it was time, he clapp\\'d his handes two, And farewell, all the revel is y-go. And yet remov\\'d they never out of the house, While they saw all the sightes marvellous; But in his study, where his bookes be, They satte still, and no wight but they three.

Look who that is most virtuous alway, Prive and apert, and most intendeth aye To do the gentle deedes that he can; And take him for the greatest gentleman. Christ will, we claim of him our gentleness, Not of our elders for their old richess. For though they gave us all their heritage, For which we claim to be of high parage, Yet may they not bequeathe, for no thing, To none of us, their virtuous living That made them gentlemen called to be, And bade us follow them in such degree. Well can the wise poet of Florence, That highte Dante, speak of this sentence: Lo, in such manner rhyme is Dante\\'s tale. \\'Full seld\\' upriseth by his branches smale Prowess of man, for God of his goodness Wills that we claim of him our gentleness;\\'  For of our elders may we nothing claim But temp\\'ral things that man may hurt and maim. Eke every wight knows this as well as I, If gentleness were planted naturally Unto a certain lineage down the line, Prive and apert, then would they never fine To do of gentleness the fair office Then might they do no villainy nor vice. Take fire, and bear it to the darkest house Betwixt this and the mount of Caucasus, And let men shut the doores, and go thenne, Yet will the fire as fair and lighte brenne As twenty thousand men might it behold; Its office natural aye will it hold, On peril of my life, till that it die. Here may ye see well how that gentery Is not annexed to possession, Since folk do not their operation Alway, as doth the fire, lo, in its kind For, God it wot, men may full often find A lorde\\'s son do shame and villainy. And he that will have price of his gent\\'ry, For he was boren of a gentle house, And had his elders noble and virtuous, And will himselfe do no gentle deedes, Nor follow his gentle ancestry, that dead is, He is not gentle, be he duke or earl; For villain sinful deedes make a churl. For gentleness is but the renomee Of thine ancestors, for their high bounte, Which is a strange thing to thy person: Thy gentleness cometh from God alone. Then comes our very gentleness of grace; It was no thing bequeath\\'d us with our place. Think how noble, as saith Valerius, Was thilke Tullius Hostilius, That out of povert\\' rose to high Read in Senec, and read eke in Boece, There shall ye see express, that it no drede is, That he is gentle that doth gentle deedes.

So did our sexton, and our fermerere, That have been true friars fifty year, -- They may now, God be thanked of his love, Make their jubilee, and walk above. And up I rose, and all our convent eke, With many a teare trilling on my cheek, Withoute noise or clattering of bells, Te Deum was our song, and nothing else, Save that to Christ I bade an orison, Thanking him of my revelation. For, Sir and Dame, truste me right well, Our orisons be more effectuel, And more we see of Christe\\'s secret things, Than borel folk, although that they be kings. We live in povert\\', and in abstinence, And borel folk in riches and dispence Of meat and drink, and in their foul delight. We have this worlde\\'s lust all in despight Lazar and Dives lived diversely, And diverse guerdon hadde they thereby. Whoso will pray, he must fast and be clean, And fat his soul, and keep his body lean We fare as saith th\\' apostle; cloth and food Suffice us, although they be not full good. The cleanness and the fasting of us freres Maketh that Christ accepteth our prayeres. Lo, Moses forty days and forty night Fasted, ere that the high God full of might Spake with him in the mountain of Sinai: With empty womb of fasting many a day Received he the lawe, that was writ With Godde\\'s finger; and Eli, well ye wit, In Mount Horeb, ere he had any speech With highe God, that is our live\\'s leech, He fasted long, and was in contemplance. Aaron, that had the temple in governance, And eke the other priestes every one, Into the temple when they shoulde gon To praye for the people, and do service, They woulde drinken in no manner wise No drinke, which that might them drunken make, But there in abstinence pray and wake, Lest that they died: take heed what I say -- But they be sober that for the people pray -- Ware that, I say -- no more: for it sufficeth. Our Lord Jesus, as Holy Writ deviseth, Gave us example of fasting and prayeres: Therefore we mendicants, we sely freres, Be wedded to povert\\' and continence, To charity, humbless, and abstinence, To persecution for righteousness, To weeping, misericorde, and to cleanness. And therefore may ye see that our prayeres (I speak of us, we mendicants, we freres), Be to the highe God more acceptable Than youres, with your feastes at your table.

But hark now, Thomas, what I shall thee sayn; I have no text of it, as I suppose, But I shall find it in a manner glose; That specially our sweet Lord Jesus Spake this of friars, when he saide thus, \\'Blessed be they that poor in spirit be\\' And so forth all the gospel may ye see, Whether it be liker our profession, Or theirs that swimmen in possession; Fy on their pomp, and on their gluttony, And on their lewedness! Me thinketh they be like Jovinian, Fat as a whale, and walking as a swan; All vinolent as bottle in the spence; Their prayer is of full great reverence; When they for soules say the Psalm of David, Lo, \\'Buf\\' they say, Cor meum eructavit. Who follow Christe\\'s gospel and his lore But we, that humble be, and chaste, and pore, Workers of Godde\\'s word, not auditours?

When mast'ry comes, the god of love anon Beateth  his wings, and, farewell, he is gone. Love is a thing as any spirit free. Women of kind desire liberty, And not to be constrained as a thrall, And so do men, if soothly I say shall. Look who that is most patient in love, He is at his advantage all above. Patience is a high virtue certain, For it vanquisheth, as these clerkes sayn, Thinges that rigour never should attain. For every word men may not chide or plain. Learne to suffer, or, so may I go, Ye shall it learn whether ye will or no. For in this world certain no wight there is, That he not doth or saith sometimes amiss. Ire, or sickness, or constellation, Wine, woe, or changing of complexion, Causeth full oft to do amiss or speaken: On every wrong a man may not be wreaken. After the time must be temperance To every wight that can of governance. And therefore hath this worthy wise knight (To live in ease) sufferance her behight; And she to him full wisly gan to swear That never should there be default in her. Here may men see a humble wife accord; Thus hath she ta'en her servant and her lord, Servant in love, and lord in marriage. Then was he both in lordship and servage? Servage? nay, but in lordship all above, Since he had both his lady and his love: His lady certes, and his wife also, The which that law of love accordeth to. And when he was in this prosperrity, Home with his wife he went to his country, Not far from Penmark, where his dwelling was, And there he liv'd in bliss and in solace. Who coulde tell, but he had wedded be, The joy, the ease, and the prosperity, That is betwixt a husband and his wife? A year and more lasted this blissful life, Till that this knight, of whom I spake thus, That of Cairrud  was call'd Arviragus, Shope him to go and dwell a year or twain In Engleland, that call'd was eke Britain, To seek in armes worship and honour (For all his lust he set in such labour); And dwelled there two years; the book saith thus.\"),\n",

Well may men know, but that it be a fool, That every part deriveth from its whole. For nature hath not ta\\'en its beginning Of no partie nor cantle of a thing, But of a thing that perfect is and stable, Descending so, till it be corruptable. And therefore of His wise purveyance He hath so well beset his ordinance, That species of things and progressions Shallen endure by successions, And not etern, withouten any lie: This mayst thou understand and see at eye. Lo th\\' oak, that hath so long a nourishing From the time that it \\'ginneth first to spring, And hath so long a life, as ye may see, Yet at the last y-wasted is the tree. Consider eke, how that the harde stone Under our feet, on which we tread and gon, Yet wasteth, as it lieth by the way. The broade river some time waxeth drey. The greate townes see we wane and wend.

What maketh this but Jupiter the king? The which is prince, and cause of alle thing, Converting all unto his proper will, From which it is derived, sooth to tell And hereagainst no creature alive, Of no degree, availeth for to strive. Then is it wisdom, as it thinketh me, To make a virtue of necessity, And take it well, that we may not eschew, And namely what to us all is due. And whoso grudgeth ought, he doth folly, And rebel is to him that all may gie. And certainly a man hath most honour To dien in his excellence and flower, When he is sicker of his goode name. Then hath he done his friend, nor him, no shame And gladder ought his friend be of his death, When with honour is yielded up his breath, Than when his name appalled is for age; For all forgotten is his vassalage. Then is it best, as for a worthy fame, To dien when a man is best of name. The contrary of all this is wilfulness. Why grudge we, why have we heaviness, That good Arcite, of chivalry the flower, Departed is, with duty and honour, Out of this foule prison of this life? Why grudge here his cousin and his wife Of his welfare, that loved him so well? Can he them thank? nay, God wot, neverdeal, -- That both his soul and eke themselves offend, And yet they may their lustes not amend. What may I conclude of this longe serie, But after sorrow I rede us to be merry, And thanke Jupiter for all his grace? And ere that we departe from this place, I rede that we make of sorrows two One perfect joye lasting evermo\\': And look now where most sorrow is herein, There will I first amenden and begin. \"Sister,\" quoth he, \"this is my full assent, With all th\\' advice here of my parlement, That gentle Palamon, your owen knight, That serveth you with will, and heart, and might, And ever hath, since first time ye him knew, That ye shall of your grace upon him rue, And take him for your husband and your lord: Lend me your hand, for this is our accord.

Come near, and take your lady by the hand.\" Betwixte them was made anon the band, That hight matrimony or marriage, By all the counsel of the baronage. And thus with alle bliss and melody Hath Palamon y-wedded Emily. And God, that all this wide world hath wrought, Send him his love, that hath it dearly bought. For now is Palamon in all his weal, Living in bliss, in riches, and in heal.

Confession is true shewing of sins to the priest, without excusing, hiding, or forwrapping [disguising] of anything, and without vaunting of good works. \"Also, it is necessary to understand whence that sins spring, and how they increase, and which they be.\" From Adam we took original sin; \"from him fleshly descended be we all, and engendered of vile and corrupt matter;\" and the penalty of Adam\\'s transgression dwelleth with us as to temptation, which penalty is called concupiscence. \"This concupiscence, when it is wrongfully disposed or ordained in a man, it maketh him covet, by covetise of flesh, fleshly sin by sight of his eyes, as to earthly things, and also covetise of highness by pride of heart.\" The Parson proceeds to shew how man is tempted in his flesh to sin; how, after his natural concupiscence, comes suggestion of the devil, that is to say the devil\\'s bellows, with which he bloweth in man the fire of con cupiscence; and how man then bethinketh him whether he will do or no the thing to which he is tempted. If he flame up into pleasure at the thought, and give way, then is he all dead in soul; \"and thus is sin accomplished, by temptation, by delight, and by consenting; and then is the sin actual.\" Sin is either venial, or deadly; deadly, when a man loves any creature more than Jesus Christ our Creator, venial, if he love Jesus Christ less than he ought. Venial sins diminish man\\'s love to God more and more, and may in this wise skip into deadly sin; for many small make a great. \"And hearken this example: A great wave of the sea cometh sometimes with so great a violence, that it drencheth [causes to sink] the ship: and the same harm do sometimes the small drops, of water that enter through a little crevice in the thurrok [hold, bilge], and in the bottom of the ship, if men be so negligent that they discharge them not betimes. And therefore, although there be difference betwixt these two causes of drenching, algates [in any case] the ship is dreint [sunk]. Right so fareth it sometimes of deadly sin,\" and of venial sins when they multiply in a man so greatly as to make him love worldly things more than God.

Of this root also springs a seed of grace, which is mother of all security, and this seed is eager and hot; and the grace of this seed springs of God, through remembrance on the day of judgment and on the pains of hell. The heat of this seed is the love of God, and the desire of everlasting joy; and this heat draws the heart of man to God, and makes him hate his sin. Penance is the tree of life to them that receive it. In penance or contrition man shall understand four things: what is contrition; what are the causes that move a man to contrition; how he should be contrite; and what contrition availeth to the soul. Contrition is the heavy and grievous sorrow that a man receiveth in his heart for his sins, with earnest purpose to confess and do penance, and never more to sin. Six causes ought to move a man to contrition: 1. He should remember him of his sins; 2. He should reflect that sin putteth a man in great thraldom, and all the greater the higher is the estate from which he falls; 3. He should dread the day of doom and the horrible pains of hell; 4. The sorrowful remembrance of the good deeds that here on earth, and also the good that he hath lost, ought to make him have contrition; 5. So also ought the remembrance of the passion that our Lord Jesus Christ suffered for our sins; 6. And so ought the hope of three things, that is to say, forgiveness of sin, the gift of grace to do well, and the glory of heaven with which God shall reward man for his good deeds. -- All these points the Parson illustrates and enforces at length; waxing especially eloquent under the third head, and plainly setting forth the sternly realistic notions regarding future punishments that were entertained in the time of Chaucer:-]'),\n",

Gluttony is unmeasurable appetite to eat or to drink; or else to do in aught to the unmeasurable appetite and disordered covetousness [craving] to eat or drink. This sin corrupted all this world, as is well shewed in the sin of Adam and of Eve. Look also what saith Saint Paul of gluttony: \"Many,\" saith he, \"go, of which I have oft said to you, and now I say it weeping, that they be enemies of the cross of Christ, of which the end is death, and of which their womb [stomach] is their God and their glory;\" in confusion of them that so savour [take delight in] earthly things.

This sin hath many species. The first is drunkenness, that is the horrible sepulture of man\\'s reason: and therefore when a man is drunken, he hath lost his reason; and this is deadly sin. But soothly, when that a man is not wont to strong drink, and peradventure knoweth not the strength of the drink, or hath feebleness in his head, or hath travailed [laboured], through which he drinketh the more, all [although] be he suddenly caught with drink, it is no deadly sin, but venial. The second species of gluttony is, that the spirit of a man waxeth all troubled for drunkenness, and bereaveth a man the discretion of his wit. The third species of gluttony is, when a man devoureth his meat, and hath no rightful manner of eating. The fourth is, when, through the great abundance of his meat, the humours of his body be distempered. The fifth is, forgetfulness by too much drinking, for which a man sometimes forgetteth by the morrow what be did at eve. In other manner be distinct the species of gluttony, after Saint Gregory. The first is, for to eat or drink before time. The second is, when a man getteth him too delicate meat or drink. The third is, when men take too much over measure [immoderately]. The fourth is curiosity [nicety] with great intent [application, pains] to make and apparel [prepare] his meat. The fifth is, for to eat too greedily.

And I say not, where I speak of division of confession, that if thou have license to shrive thee to a discreet and an honest priest, and where thee liketh, and by the license of thy curate, that thou mayest not well shrive thee to him of all thy sins: but let no blot be behind, let no sin be untold as far as thou hast remembrance.

Thou shalt not paint thy confession with fair and subtle words, to cover the more thy sin; for then beguilest thou thyself, and not the priest; thou must tell it plainly, be it never so foul nor so horrible.

       "  '[Penitence is described, on the authority of Saints Ambrose, Isidore, and Gregory, as the bewailing of sin that has been wrought, with the purpose never again to do that thing, or any other thing which a man should bewail; for weeping and not ceasing to do the sin will not avail -- though it is to be hoped that after every time that a man falls, be it ever so often, he may find grace to arise through penitence. And repentant folk that leave their sin ere sin leave them, are accounted by Holy Church sure of their salvation, even though the repentance be at the last hour. There are three actions of penitence; that a man be baptized after he has sinned; that he do no deadly sin after receiving baptism; and that he fall into no venial sins from day to day. \"Thereof saith St Augustine, that penitence of good and humble folk is the penitence of every day.\" The species of penitence are three: solemn, when a man is openly expelled from Holy Church in Lent, or is compelled by Holy Church to do open penance for an open sin openly talked of in the country; common penance, enjoined by priests in certain cases, as to go on pilgrimage naked or barefoot; and privy penance, which men do daily for private sins, of which they confess privately and receive private penance. To very perfect penitence are behoveful and necessary three things: contrition of heart, confession of mouth, and satisfaction; which are fruitful penitence against delight in thinking, reckless speech, and wicked sinful works.'),\n",

Now be there two manner of prides; the one of them is within the heart of a man, and the other is without. Of which soothly these foresaid things, and more than I have said, appertain to pride that is within the heart of a man and there be other species of pride that be without: but nevertheless, the one of these species of pride is sign of the other, right as the gay levesell [bush] at the tavern is sign of the wine that is in the cellar. And this is in many things: as in speech and countenance, and outrageous array of clothing; for certes, if there had been no sin in clothing, Christ would not so soon have noted and spoken of the clothing of that rich man in the gospel. And Saint Gregory saith, that precious clothing is culpable for the dearth [dearness] of it, and for its softness, and for its strangeness and disguising, and for the superfluity or for the inordinate scantness of it; alas! may not a man see in our days the sinful costly array of clothing, and namely [specially] in too much superfluity, or else in too disordinate scantness? As to the first sin, in superfluity of clothing, which that maketh it so dear, to the harm of the people, not only the cost of the embroidering, the disguising, indenting or barring, ounding, paling,  winding, or banding, and semblable [similar] waste of cloth in vanity; but there is also the costly furring [lining or edging with fur] in their gowns, so much punching of chisels to make holes, so much dagging [cutting] of shears, with the superfluity in length of the foresaid gowns, trailing in the dung and in the mire, on horse and eke on foot, as well of man as of woman, that all that trailing is verily (as in effect) wasted, consumed, threadbare, and rotten with dung, rather than it is given to the poor, to great damage of the foresaid poor folk, and that in sundry wise: this is to say, the more that cloth is wasted, the more must it cost to the poor people for the scarceness; and furthermore, if so be that they would give such punched and dagged clothing to the poor people, it is not convenient to wear for their estate, nor sufficient to boot [help, remedy] their necessity, to keep them from the distemperance [inclemency] of the firmament. Upon the other side, to speak of the horrible disordinate scantness of clothing, as be these cutted slops or hanselines [breeches] , that through their shortness cover not the shameful member of man, to wicked intent alas! some of them shew the boss and the shape of the horrible swollen members, that seem like to the malady of hernia, in the wrapping of their hosen, and eke the buttocks of them, that fare as it were the hinder part of a she-ape in the full of the moon. And more over the wretched swollen members that they shew through disguising, in departing [dividing] of their hosen in white and red, seemeth that half their shameful privy members were flain [flayed]. And if so be that they depart their hosen in other colours, as is white and blue, or white and black, or black and red, and so forth; then seemeth it, by variance of colour, that the half part of their privy members be corrupt by the fire of Saint Anthony, or by canker, or other such mischance. And of the hinder part of their buttocks it is full horrible to see, for certes, in that part of their body where they purge their stinking ordure, that foul part shew they to the people proudly in despite of honesty [decency], which honesty Jesus Christ and his friends observed to shew in his life. Now as of the outrageous array of women, God wot, that though the visages of some of them seem full chaste and debonair [gentle], yet notify they, in their array of attire, likerousness and pride. I say not that honesty [reasonable and appropriate style] in clothing of man or woman unconvenable but, certes, the superfluity or disordinate scarcity of clothing is reprovable. Also the sin of their ornament, or of apparel, as in things that appertain to riding, as in too many delicate horses, that be holden for delight, that be so fair, fat, and costly; and also in many a vicious knave, [servant] that is sustained because of them; in curious harness, as in saddles, cruppers, peytrels, [breast-plates] and bridles, covered with precious cloth and rich bars and plates of gold and silver. For which God saith by Zechariah the prophet, \"I will confound the riders of such horses.\" These folk take little regard of the riding of God\\'s Son of heaven, and of his harness, when he rode upon an ass, and had no other harness but the poor clothes of his disciples; nor we read not that ever he rode on any other beast. I speak this for the sin of superfluity, and not for reasonable honesty [seemliness], when reason it requireth. And moreover, certes, pride is greatly notified in holding of great meinie [retinue of servants], when they be of little profit or of right no profit, and namely [especially] when that meinie is felonous [violent ] and damageous [harmful] to the people by hardiness [arrogance] of high lordship, or by way of office; for certes, such lords sell then their lordship to the devil of hell, when they sustain the wickedness of their meinie. Or else, when these folk of low degree, as they that hold hostelries, sustain theft of their hostellers, and that is in many manner of deceits: that manner of folk be the flies that follow the honey, or else the hounds that follow the carrion. Such foresaid folk strangle spiritually their lordships; for which thus saith David the prophet, \"Wicked death may come unto these lordships, and God give that they may descend into hell adown; for in their houses is iniquity and shrewedness, [impiety] and not God of heaven.\" And certes, but if [unless] they do amendment, right as God gave his benison [blessing] to Laban by the service of Jacob, and to Pharaoh by the service of Joseph; right so God will give his malison [condemnation] to such lordships as sustain the wickedness of their servants, but [unless] they come to amendment. Pride of the table apaireth [worketh harm] eke full oft; for, certes, rich men be called to feasts, and poor folk be put away and rebuked; also in excess of divers meats and drinks, and namely [specially] such manner bake-meats and dish-meats burning of wild fire, and painted and castled with paper, and semblable [similar] waste, so that it is abuse to think. And eke in too great preciousness of vessel, [plate] and curiosity of minstrelsy, by which a man is stirred more to the delights of luxury, if so be that he set his heart the less upon our Lord Jesus Christ, certain it is a sin; and certainly the delights might be so great in this case, that a man might lightly [easily] fall by them into deadly sin.'),\n",

First, it must be in sorrowful bitterness of spirit; a condition that has five signs -- shamefastness, humility in heart and outward sign, weeping with the bodily eyes or in the heart, disregard of the shame that might curtail or garble confession, and obedience to the penance enjoined. Secondly, true confession must be promptly made, for dread of death, of increase of sinfulness, of forgetfulness of what should be confessed, of Christ's refusal to hear if it be put off to the last day of life; and this condition has four terms; that confession be well pondered beforehand, that the man confessing have comprehended in his mind the number and greatness of his sins and how long he has lain in sin, that he be contrite for and eschew his sins, and that he fear and flee the occasions for that sin to which he is inclined. -- What follows under this head is of some interest for the light which it throws on the rigorous government wielded by the Romish Church in those days --]\"),\n",

       "  \"(Dame Prudence, seeing her husband's resolution thus taken, in full humble wise, when she saw her time, begins to counsel him against war, by a warning against haste in requital of either good or evil. counsel, because he should be held a fool if he rejected for her advice the opinion of so many wise men; because all women are bad; because it would seem that he had given her the mastery over him; and because she could not keep his secret, if he resolved to follow her advice. To these reasons Prudence answers that it is no folly to change counsel when things, or men's judgements of them, change -- especially to alter a resolution taken on the impulse of a great multitude of folk, where every man crieth and clattereth what him liketh; that if all women had been wicked, Jesus Christ would never have descended to be born of a woman, nor have showed himself first to a woman after his resurrection and that when Solomon said he had found no good woman, he meant that God alone was supremely good;  that her husband would not seem to give her the mastery by following her counsel, for he had his own free choice in following or rejecting it; and that he knew well and had often tested her great silence, patience, and secrecy. And whereas he had quoted a saying, that in wicked counsel women vanquish men, she reminds him that she would counsel him against doing a wickedness on which he had set his mind, and cites instances to show that many women have been and yet are full good, and their counsel wholesome and profitable. Lastly, she quotes the words of God himself, when he was about to make woman as an help meet for man; and promises that, if her husband will trust her counsel, she will restore to him his daughter whole and sound, and make him have honour in this case. wife's sweet words, and also because he has proved and assayed her great wisdom and her great truth, he will govern him by her counsel in all things. Thus encouraged, Prudence enters on a long discourse, full of learned citations, regarding the manner in which counsellors should be chosen and consulted, and the times and reasons for changing a counsel. First, God must be besought for guidance. Then a man must well examine his own thoughts, of such things as he holds to be best for his own profit; driving out of his heart anger, covetousness, and hastiness, which perturb and pervert the judgement. Then he must keep his counsel secret, unless confiding it to another shall be more profitable; but, in so confiding it, he shall say nothing to bias the mind of the counsellor toward flattery or subserviency. After that he should consider his friends and his enemies, choosing of the former such as be most faithful and wise, and eldest and most approved in counselling; and even of these only a few. Then he must eschew the counselling of fools, of flatterers, of his old enemies that be reconciled, of servants who bear him great reverence and fear, of folk that be drunken and can hide no counsel, of such as counsel one thing privily and the contrary openly; and of young folk, for their counselling is not ripe. Then, in examining his counsel, he must truly tell his tale; he must consider whether the thing he proposes to do be reasonable, within his power, and acceptable to the more part and the better part of his counsellors; he must look at the things that may follow from that counselling, choosing the best and waiving all besides; he must consider the root whence the matter of his counsel is engendered, what and from what causes they be sprung. examined his counsel and approved it by many wise folk and old, he shall consider if he may perform it and make of it a good end; if he be in doubt, he shall choose rather to suffer than to begin; but otherwise he shall prosecute his resolution steadfastly till the enterprise be at an end. As to changing his counsel, a man may do so without reproach, if the cause cease, or when a new case betides, or if he find that by error or otherwise harm or damage may result, or if his counsel be dishonest or come of dishonest cause, or if it be impossible or may not properly be kept; and he must take it for a general rule, that every counsel which is affirmed so strongly, that it may not be changed for any condition that may betide, that counsel is wicked. Meliboeus, admitting that his wife had spoken well and suitably as to counsellors and counsel in general, prays her to tell him in especial what she thinks of the counsellors whom they have chosen in their present need. Prudence replies that his counsel in this case could not properly be called a counselling, but a movement of folly; and points out that he has erred in sundry wise against the rules which he had just laid down. Granting that he has erred, Meliboeus says that he is all ready to change his counsel right as she will devise; for, as the proverb runs, to do sin is human, but to persevere long in sin is work of the Devil. Prudence then minutely recites, analyses, and criticises the counsel given to her husband in the assembly of his friends. She commends the advice of the physicians and surgeons, and urges that they should be well rewarded for their noble speech and their services in healing Sophia; and she asks Meliboeus how he understands their proposition that one contrary must be cured by another contrary. Meliboeus answers, that he should do vengeance on his enemies, who had done him wrong. Prudence, however, insists that vengeance is not the contrary of vengeance, nor wrong of wrong, but the like; and that wickedness should be healed by goodness, discord by accord, war by peace. lawyers and wise folk that advised Meliboeus to take prudent measures for the security of his body and of his house. First, she would have her husband pray for the protection and aid of Christ; then commit the keeping of his person to his true friends; then suspect and avoid all strange folk, and liars, and such people as she had already warned him against; then beware of presuming on his strength, or the weakness of his adversary, and neglecting to guard his person -- for every wise man dreadeth his enemy; then he should evermore be on the watch against ambush and all espial, even in what seems a place of safety; though he should not be so cowardly, as to fear where is no cause for dread; yet he should dread to be poisoned, and therefore shun scorners, and fly their words as venom. the fortification of his house, she points out that towers and great edifices are costly and laborious, yet useless unless defended by true friends that be old and wise; and the greatest and strongest garrison that a rich man may have, as well to keep his person as his goods, is, that he be beloved by his subjects and by his neighbours. Warmly approving the counsel that in all this business Meliboeus should proceed with great diligence and deliberation, Prudence goes on to examine the advice given by his neighbours that do him reverence without love, his old enemies reconciled, his flatterers that counselled him certain things privily and openly counselled him the contrary, and the young folk that counselled him to avenge himself and make war at once. powerful enemies, whose kindred are numerous and close, while his are fewer and remote in relationship; that only the judge who has jurisdiction in a case may take sudden vengeance on any man; that her husband's power does not accord with his desire; and that, if he did take vengeance, it would only breed fresh wrongs and contests. As to the causes of the wrong done to him, she holds that God, the causer of all things, has permitted him to suffer because he has drunk so much honey  of sweet temporal riches, and delights, and honours of this world, that he is drunken, and has forgotten Jesus Christ his Saviour; the three enemies of mankind, the flesh, the fiend, and the world, have entered his heart by the windows of his body, and wounded his soul in five places -- that is to say, the deadly sins that have entered into his heart by the five senses; and in the same manner Christ has suffered his three enemies to enter his house by the windows, and wound his daughter in the five places before specified. Meliboeus demurs, that if his wife's objections prevailed, vengeance would never be taken, and thence great mischiefs would arise; but Prudence replies that the taking of vengeance lies with the judges, to whom the private individual must have recourse. vengeance does not please him, and that, as Fortune has nourished and helped him from his childhood, he will now assay her, trusting, with God's help, that she will aid him to avenge his shame. Prudence warns him against trusting to Fortune, all the less because she has hitherto favoured him, for just on that account she is the more likely to fail him; and she calls on him to leave his vengeance with the Sovereign Judge, that avengeth all villainies and wrongs. Meliboeus argues that if he refrains from taking vengeance he will invite his enemies to do him further wrong, and he will be put and held over low; but Prudence contends that such a result can be brought about only by the neglect of the judges, not by the patience of the individual. repeats that he is not strong enough, and quotes the common saw, that it is madness for a man to strive with a stronger than himself, peril to strive with one of equal strength, and folly to strive with a weaker. But, considering his own defaults and demerits, -- remembering the patience of Christ and the undeserved tribulations of the saints, the brevity of this life with all its trouble and sorrow, the discredit thrown on the wisdom and training of he should refrain wholly from taking vengeance. Meliboeus submits that he is not at all a perfect man, and his heart will never be at peace until he is avenged; and that as his enemies disregarded the peril when they attacked him, so he might, without reproach, incur some peril in attacking them in return, even though he did a great excess in avenging one wrong by another. Prudence strongly deprecates all outrage or excess; but Meliboeus insists that he cannot see that it might greatly harm him though he took a vengeance, for he is richer and mightier than his enemies, and all things obey money. Prudence thereupon launches into a long dissertation on the advantages of riches, the evils of poverty, the means by which wealth should be gathered, and the manner in which it should be used; and concludes by counselling her husband not to move war and battle through trust in his riches, for they suffice not to maintain war, the battle is not always to the strong or the numerous, and the perils of conflict are many. Meliboeus then curtly asks her for her counsel how he shall do in this need; and she answers that certainly she counsels him to agree with his adversaries and have peace with them. Meliboeus on this cries out that plainly she loves not his honour or his worship, in counselling him to go and humble himself before his enemies, crying mercy to them that, having done him so grievous wrong, ask him not to be reconciled. Then Prudence, making semblance of wrath, retorts that she loves his honour and profit as she loves her own, and ever has done; she cites the Scriptures in support of her counsel to seek peace; and says she will leave him to his own courses, for she knows well he is so stubborn, that he will do nothing for her. Meliboeus then relents; admits that he is angry and cannot judge aright; and puts himself wholly in her hands, promising to do just as she desires, and admitting that he is the more held to love and praise her, if she reproves him of his folly)\"),\n",

Sloth, or \"Accidie,\" which comes after the sin of Anger, because Envy blinds the eyes of a man, and Anger troubleth a man, and Sloth maketh him heavy, thoughtful, and peevish. It is opposed to every estate of man -- as unfallen, and held to work in praising and adoring God; as sinful, and held to labour in praying for deliverance from sin; and as in the state of grace, and held to works of penitence. It resembles the heavy and sluggish condition of those in hell; it will suffer no hardness and no penance; it prevents any beginning of good works; it causes despair of God\\'s mercy, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost; it induces somnolency and neglect of communion in prayer with God; and it breeds negligence or recklessness, that cares for nothing, and is the nurse of all mischiefs, if ignorance is their mother. Against Sloth, and these and other branches and fruits of it, the remedy lies in the virtue of fortitude or strength, in its various species of magnanimity or great courage; faith and hope in God and his saints; surety or sickerness, when a man fears nothing that can oppose the good works he has under taken; magnificence, when he carries out great works of goodness begun; constancy or stableness of heart; and other incentives to energy and laborious service: (5.) Avarice, or Covetousness, which is the root of all harms, since its votaries are idolaters, oppressors and enslavers of men, deceivers of their equals in business, simoniacs, gamblers, liars, thieves, false swearers, blasphemers, murderers, and sacrilegious.

What shall I say of Hasdrubale\\'s wife, That at Carthage bereft herself of life? For, when she saw the Romans win the town, She took her children all, and skipt adown Into the fire, and rather chose to die, Than any Roman did her villainy. Hath not Lucretia slain herself, alas! At Rome, when that she oppressed was Of Tarquin? for her thought it was a shame To live, when she hadde lost her name. The seven maidens of Milesie also Have slain themselves for very dread and woe, Rather than folk of Gaul them should oppress. More than a thousand stories, as I guess, Could I now tell as touching this mattere. When Abradate was slain, his wife so dear  Herselfe slew, and let her blood to glide In Abradate\\'s woundes, deep and wide, And said, \\'My body at the leaste way There shall no wight defoul, if that I may.\\' Why should I more examples hereof sayn? Since that so many have themselves slain, Well rather than they would defouled be, I will conclude that it is bet for me To slay myself, than be defouled thus. I will be true unto Arviragus, Or elles slay myself in some mannere, As did Demotione\\'s daughter dear, Because she woulde not defouled be. O Sedasus, it is full great pity To reade how thy daughters died, alas! That slew themselves for suche manner cas. As great a pity was it, or well more, The Theban maiden, that for Nicanor Herselfe slew, right for such manner woe. Another Theban maiden did right so; For one of Macedon had her oppress\\'d, She with her death her maidenhead redress\\'d. What shall I say of Niceratus\\' wife, That for such case bereft herself her life? How true was eke to Alcibiades His love, that for to dien rather chese, Than for to suffer his body unburied be? Lo, what a wife was Alceste?\" quoth she. \"What saith Homer of good Penelope? All Greece knoweth of her chastity. Pardie, of Laedamia is written thus, That when at Troy was slain Protesilaus,  No longer would she live after his day.

And thus within a while his name sprung Both of his deedes, and of his good tongue, That Theseus hath taken him so near, That of his chamber he hath made him squire, And gave him gold to maintain his degree; And eke men brought him out of his country From year to year full privily his rent. But honestly and slyly he it spent, That no man wonder\\'d how that he it had. And three year in this wise his life be lad, And bare him so in peace and eke in werre, There was no man that Theseus had so derre. And in this blisse leave I now Arcite, And speak I will of Palamon a lite. \\t In darkness horrible, and strong prison, This seven year hath sitten Palamon, Forpined, what for love, and for distress. Who feeleth double sorrow and heaviness But Palamon? that love distraineth so, That wood out of his wits he went for woe, And eke thereto he is a prisonere Perpetual, not only for a year. Who coulde rhyme in English properly His martyrdom? forsooth, it is not I; Therefore I pass as lightly as I may. It fell that in the seventh year, in May The thirde night (as olde bookes sayn, That all this story tellen more plain), Were it by a venture or destiny (As when a thing is shapen it shall be), That soon after the midnight, Palamon By helping of a friend brake his prison, And fled the city fast as he might go, For he had given drink his gaoler so Of a clary , made of a certain wine, With narcotise and opie of Thebes fine, That all the night, though that men would him shake, The gaoler slept, he mighte not awake: And thus he fled as fast as ever he may. The night was short, and faste by the day That needes cast he must himself to hide. And to a grove faste there beside With dreadful foot then stalked Palamon. For shortly this was his opinion, That in the grove he would him hide all day, And in the night then would he take his way To Thebes-ward, his friendes for to pray On Theseus to help him to warray. And shortly either he would lose his life, Or winnen Emily unto his wife. This is th\\' effect, and his intention plain. \\t Now will I turn to Arcita again, That little wist how nighe was his care, Till that Fortune had brought him in the snare. The busy lark, the messenger of day, Saluteth in her song the morning gray; And fiery Phoebus riseth up so bright, That all the orient laugheth at the sight, And with his streames drieth in the greves The silver droppes, hanging on the leaves; And Arcite, that is in the court royal With Theseus, his squier principal, Is ris\\'n, and looketh on the merry day. And for to do his observance to May, Remembering the point of his desire, He on his courser, starting as the fire, Is ridden to the fieldes him to play, Out of the court, were it a mile or tway. And to the grove, of which I have you told, By a venture his way began to hold, To make him a garland of the greves, Were it of woodbine, or of hawthorn leaves, And loud he sang against the sun so sheen. \"O May, with all thy flowers and thy green, Right welcome be thou, faire freshe May, I hope that I some green here getten may.\" And from his courser, with a lusty heart, Into the grove full hastily he start, And in a path he roamed up and down, There as by aventure this Palamon Was in a bush, that no man might him see, For sore afeard of his death was he. Nothing ne knew he that it was Arcite; God wot he would have trowed it full lite. But sooth is said, gone since full many years, The field hath eyen, and the wood hath ears, It is full fair a man to bear him even, For all day meeten men at unset steven. Full little wot Arcite of his fellaw, That was so nigh to hearken of his saw, For in the bush he sitteth now full still. When that Arcite had roamed all his fill, And sungen all the roundel lustily, Into a study he fell suddenly, As do those lovers in their quainte gears, Now in the crop, and now down in the breres,  Now up, now down, as bucket in a well. Right as the Friday, soothly for to tell, Now shineth it, and now it raineth fast, Right so can geary Venus overcast The heartes of her folk, right as her day Is gearful, right so changeth she array. Seldom is Friday all the weeke like. When Arcite had y-sung, he gan to sike, And sat him down withouten any more: \"Alas!\" quoth he, \"the day that I was bore! How longe, Juno, through thy cruelty Wilt thou warrayen Thebes the city? Alas! y-brought is to confusion The blood royal of Cadm\\' and Amphion: Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man, That Thebes built, or first the town began, And of the city first was crowned king. Of his lineage am I, and his offspring By very line, as of the stock royal; And now I am so caitiff and so thrall, That he that is my mortal enemy, I serve him as his squier poorely. And yet doth Juno me well more shame, For I dare not beknow mine owen name, But there as I was wont to hight Arcite, Now hight I Philostrate, not worth a mite. Alas! thou fell Mars, and alas!

Ye slay me with your eyen, Emily; Ye be the cause wherefore that I die. Of all the remnant of mine other care Ne set I not the mountance of a tare, So that I could do aught to your pleasance.\" \\t And with that word he fell down in a trance A longe time; and afterward upstart This Palamon, that thought thorough his heart He felt a cold sword suddenly to glide: For ire he quoke, no longer would he hide. And when that he had heard Arcite\\'s tale, As he were wood, with face dead and pale, He start him up out of the bushes thick, And said: \"False Arcita, false traitor wick\\', Now art thou hent, that lov\\'st my lady so, For whom that I have all this pain and woe, And art my blood, and to my counsel sworn, As I full oft have told thee herebeforn, And hast bejaped here Duke Theseus, And falsely changed hast thy name thus; I will be dead, or elles thou shalt die. Thou shalt not love my lady Emily, But I will love her only and no mo\\'; For I am Palamon thy mortal foe. And though I have no weapon in this place, But out of prison am astart by grace, I dreade not that either thou shalt die, Or else thou shalt not loven Emily. Choose which thou wilt, for thou shalt not astart.\" \\t This Arcite then, with full dispiteous heart, When he him knew, and had his tale heard, As fierce as lion pulled out a swerd, And saide thus; \"By God that sitt\\'th above, N\\'ere it that thou art sick, and wood for love, And eke that thou no weap\\'n hast in this place, Thou should\\'st never out of this grove pace, That thou ne shouldest dien of mine hand. For I defy the surety and the band, Which that thou sayest I have made to thee. What? very fool, think well that love is free; And I will love her maugre all thy might. But, for thou art a worthy gentle knight, And wilnest to darraine her by bataille, Have here my troth, to-morrow I will not fail, Without weeting of any other wight, That here I will be founden as a knight, And bringe harness right enough for thee; And choose the best, and leave the worst for me. And meat and drinke this night will I bring Enough for thee, and clothes for thy bedding. And if so be that thou my lady win, And slay me in this wood that I am in, Thou may\\'st well have thy lady as for me.\" This Palamon answer\\'d, \"I grant it thee.\" And thus they be departed till the morrow, When each of them hath laid his faith to borrow. \\t O Cupid, out of alle charity! O Regne that wilt no fellow have with thee! Full sooth is said, that love nor lordeship Will not, his thanks, have any fellowship. Well finden that Arcite and Palamon. Arcite is ridd anon unto the town, And on the morrow, ere it were daylight, Full privily two harness hath he dight, Both suffisant and meete to darraine The battle in the field betwixt them twain. And on his horse, alone as he was born, He carrieth all this harness him beforn; And in the grove, at time and place y-set, This Arcite and this Palamon be met. Then change gan the colour of their face; Right as the hunter in the regne of Thrace That standeth at a gappe with a spear When hunted is the lion or the bear, And heareth him come rushing in the greves, And breaking both the boughes and the leaves, Thinketh, \"Here comes my mortal enemy, Withoute fail, he must be dead or I; For either I must slay him at the gap; Or he must slay me, if that me mishap:\" So fared they, in changing of their hue As far as either of them other knew. There was no good day, and no saluting, But straight, withoute wordes rehearsing, Evereach of them holp to arm the other, As friendly, as he were his owen brother. And after that, with sharpe speares strong They foined each at other wonder long. Thou mightest weene, that this Palamon In fighting were as a wood lion, And as a cruel tiger was Arcite: As wilde boars gan they together smite, That froth as white as foam, for ire wood. Up to the ancle fought they in their blood. And in this wise I let them fighting dwell, And forth I will of Theseus you tell. \\t The Destiny, minister general, That executeth in the world o\\'er all The purveyance, that God hath seen beforn; So strong it is, that though the world had sworn The contrary of a thing by yea or nay, Yet some time it shall fallen on a day That falleth not eft in a thousand year. For certainly our appetites here, Be it of war, or peace, or hate, or love, All is this ruled by the sight above. This mean I now by mighty Theseus, That for to hunten is so desirous -- And namely the greate hart in May -- That in his bed there dawneth him no day That he n\\'is clad, and ready for to ride With hunt and horn, and houndes him beside. For in his hunting hath he such delight, That it is all his joy and appetite To be himself the greate harte\\'s bane For after Mars he serveth now Diane. Clear was the day, as I have told ere this, And Theseus, with alle joy and bliss, With his Hippolyta, the faire queen, And Emily, y-clothed all in green, On hunting be they ridden royally. And to the grove, that stood there faste by, In which there was an hart, as men him told, Duke Theseus the straighte way doth hold, And to the laund he rideth him full right, There was the hart y-wont to have his flight, And over a brook, and so forth on his way. This Duke will have a course at him or tway With houndes, such as him lust to command.

Metellius, the foule churl, the swine, That with a staff bereft his wife of life For she drank wine, though I had been his wife, Never should he have daunted me from drink: And, after wine, of Venus most I think. For all so sure as cold engenders hail, A liquorish mouth must have a liquorish tail. In woman vinolent is no defence, This knowe lechours by experience. But, lord Christ, when that it rememb\\'reth me Upon my youth, and on my jollity, It tickleth me about mine hearte-root; Unto this day it doth mine hearte boot, That I have had my world as in my time. But age, alas! that all will envenime, Hath me bereft my beauty and my pith: Let go; farewell; the devil go therewith. The flour is gon, there is no more to tell, The bran, as I best may, now must I sell. But yet to be right merry will I fand. Now forth to tell you of my fourth husband, I say, I in my heart had great despite, That he of any other had delight; But he was quit, by God and by Saint Joce: I made for him of the same wood a cross; Not of my body in no foul mannere, But certainly I made folk such cheer, That in his owen grease I made him fry For anger, and for very jealousy. By God, in earth I was his purgatory, For which I hope his soul may be in glory. For, God it wot, he sat full oft and sung, When that his shoe full bitterly him wrung. There was no wight, save God and he, that wist In many wise how sore I did him twist. He died when I came from Jerusalem, And lies in grave under the roode beam: Although his tomb is not so curious As was the sepulchre of Darius, Which that Apelles wrought so subtlely. It is but waste to bury them preciously. Let him fare well, God give his soule rest, He is now in his grave and in his chest. \\t Now of my fifthe husband will I tell: God let his soul never come into hell. And yet was he to me the moste shrew; That feel I on my ribbes all by rew, And ever shall, until mine ending day. But in our bed he was so fresh and gay, And therewithal so well he could me glose, When that he woulde have my belle chose, Though he had beaten me on every bone, Yet could he win again my love anon. I trow, I lov\\'d him better, for that he Was of his love so dangerous to me. We women have, if that I shall not lie, In this matter a quainte fantasy. Whatever thing we may not lightly have, Thereafter will we cry all day and crave. Forbid us thing, and that desire we; Press on us fast, and thenne will we flee.

Out of the ground a fire infernal start, From Pluto sent, at request of Saturn For which his horse for fear began to turn, And leap aside, and founder as he leap And ere that Arcite may take any keep, He pight him on the pummel of his head.

To other woundes, and to broken arms, Some hadden salves, and some hadden charms: And pharmacies of herbs, and eke save They dranken, for they would their lives have. For which this noble Duke, as he well can, Comforteth and honoureth every man, And made revel all the longe night, Unto the strange lordes, as was right. Nor there was holden no discomforting, But as at jousts or at a tourneying; For soothly there was no discomfiture, For falling is not but an aventure.

And if that you shall ever be a wife, Forget not Palamon, the gentle man.\" \\t And with that word his speech to fail began. For from his feet up to his breast was come The cold of death, that had him overnome. And yet moreover in his armes two The vital strength is lost, and all ago.

He was, I trow, a twenty winter old, And I was forty, if I shall say sooth, But yet I had always a colte's tooth. Gat-toothed I was, and that became me well, I had the print of Sainte Venus' seal. [As help me God, I was a lusty one, And fair, and rich, and young, and well begone: For certes I am all venerian In feeling, and my heart is martian; Venus me gave my lust and liquorishness, And Mars gave me my sturdy hardiness.]  Mine ascendant was Taure, and Mars therein: Alas, alas, that ever love was sin!

       "  'and come upon the heads of damned folk;\" and this is, forasmuch as the higher that they were in this present life, the more shall they be abated [abased] and defouled in hell. Against the riches of this world shall they have misease [trouble, torment] of poverty, and this poverty shall be in four things: in default [want] of treasure; of which David saith, \"The rich folk that embraced and oned [united] all their heart to treasure of this world, shall sleep in the sleeping of death, and nothing shall they find in their hands of all their treasure.\" And moreover, the misease of hell shall be in default of meat and drink. For God saith thus by Moses, \"They shall be wasted with hunger, and the birds of hell shall devour them with bitter death, and the gall of the dragon shall be their drink, and the venom of the dragon their morsels.\" And furthermore, their misease shall be in default of clothing, for they shall be naked in body, as of clothing, save the fire in which they burn, and other filths; and naked shall they be in soul, of all manner virtues, which that is the clothing of the soul. Where be then the gay robes, and the soft sheets, and the fine shirts? Lo, what saith of them the prophet Isaiah, that under them shall be strewed moths, and their covertures shall be of worms of hell. And furthermore, their misease shall be in default of friends, for he is not poor that hath good friends: but there is no friend; for neither God nor any good creature shall be friend to them, and evereach of them shall hate other with deadly hate. The Sons and the daughters shall rebel against father and mother, and kindred against kindred, and chide and despise each other, both day and night, as God saith by the prophet Micah. And the loving children, that whom loved so fleshly each other, would each of them eat the other if they might. For how should they love together in the pains of hell, when they hated each other in the prosperity of this life? For trust well, their fleshly love was deadly hate; as saith the prophet David; \"Whoso loveth wickedness, he hateth his own soul:\" and whoso hateth his own soul, certes he may love none other wight in no manner: and therefore in hell is no solace nor no friendship, but ever the more kindreds that be in hell, the more cursing, the more chiding, and the more deadly hate there is among them. And furtherover, they shall have default of all manner delights; for certes delights be after the appetites of the five wits [senses]; as sight, hearing, smelling, savouring [tasting], and touching. But in hell their sight shall be full of darkness and of smoke, and their eyes full of tears; and their hearing full of waimenting [lamenting] and grinting [gnashing] of teeth, as saith Jesus Christ; their nostrils shall be full of stinking; and, as saith Isaiah the prophet, their savouring bitter gall; and touching of all their body shall be covered with fire that never shall quench, and with worms that never shall die, as God saith by the mouth of Isaiah. And forasmuch as they shall not ween that they may die for pain, and by death flee from pain, that may they understand in the word of Job, that saith, \"There is the shadow of death.\" Certes a shadow hath the likeness of the thing of which it is shadowed, but the shadow is not the same thing of which it is shadowed: right so fareth the pain of hell; it is like death, for the horrible anguish; and why? for it paineth them ever as though they should die anon; but certes they shall not die. For, as saith Saint Gregory, \"To wretched caitiffs shall be given death without death, and end without end, and default without failing; for their death shall always live, and their end shall evermore begin, and their default shall never fail.\" And therefore saith Saint John the Evangelist, \"They shall follow death, and they shall not find him, and they shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.\" And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath created all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order. For the earth shall bear them no fruit (for, as the prophet David saith, \"God shall destroy the fruit of the earth, as for them\"); nor water shall give them no moisture, nor the air no refreshing, nor the fire no light. For as saith Saint Basil, \"The burning of world shall God give in hell to them that be damned, but the light and the clearness shall be given in heaven to his children; right as the good man giveth flesh to his children, and bones to his hounds.\" And for they shall have no hope to escape, saith Job at last, that there shall horror and grisly dread dwell without end. Horror is always dread of harm that is to come, and this dread shall ever dwell in the hearts of them that be damned. And therefore have they lost all their hope for seven causes. First, for God that is their judge shall be without mercy to them; nor they may not please him; nor none of his hallows [saints]; nor they may give nothing for their ransom; nor they have no voice to speak to him; nor they may not flee from pain; nor they have no goodness in them that they may shew to deliver them from pain. \\t [Under the fourth head, of good works, the Parson says: --] \\t The courteous Lord Jesus Christ will that no good work be lost, for in somewhat it shall avail. But forasmuch as the good works that men do while they be in good life be all amortised [killed, deadened] by sin following, and also since all the good works that men do while they be in deadly sin be utterly dead, as for to have the life perdurable [everlasting], well may that man that no good works doth, sing that new French song, J\\'ai tout perdu -- mon temps et mon labour . For certes, sin bereaveth a man both the goodness of nature, and eke the goodness of grace. For soothly the grace of the Holy Ghost fareth like fire, that may not be idle; for fire faileth anon as it forleteth [leaveth] its working, and right so grace faileth anon as it forleteth its working. Then loseth the sinful man the goodness of glory, that only is to good men that labour and work. Well may he be sorry then, that oweth '),\n",

       "  'Whilom there was dwelling in Lombardy A worthy knight, that born was at Pavie, In which he liv\\'d in great prosperity; And forty years a wifeless man was he, And follow\\'d aye his bodily delight On women, where as was his appetite, As do these fooles that be seculeres. And, when that he was passed sixty years, Were it for holiness, or for dotage, I cannot say, but such a great corage Hadde this knight to be a wedded man, That day and night he did all that he can To espy where that he might wedded be; Praying our Lord to grante him, that he Mighte once knowen of that blissful life That is betwixt a husband and his wife, And for to live under that holy bond With which God firste man and woman bond. \"None other life,\" said he, \"is worth a bean; For wedlock is so easy, and so clean, That in this world it is a paradise.\" Thus said this olde knight, that was so wise. And certainly, as sooth as God is king, To take a wife it is a glorious thing, And namely when a man is old and hoar, Then is a wife the fruit of his treasor; Then should he take a young wife and a fair, On which he might engender him an heir, And lead his life in joy and in solace; Whereas these bachelors singen \"Alas!\" When that they find any adversity In love, which is but childish vanity. And truely it sits well to be so, That bachelors have often pain and woe: On brittle ground they build, and brittleness They finde when they weene sickerness: They live but as a bird or as a beast, In liberty, and under no arrest; Whereas a wedded man in his estate Liveth a life blissful and ordinate, Under the yoke of marriage y-bound; Well may his heart in joy and bliss abound. For who can be so buxom as a wife? Who is so true, and eke so attentive To keep him, sick and whole, as is his make? For weal or woe she will him not forsake: She is not weary him to love and serve, Though that he lie bedrid until he sterve. And yet some clerkes say it is not so; Of which he, Theophrast, is one of tho: What force though Theophrast list for to lie? \\t \"Take no wife,\" quoth he,  \"for husbandry, As for to spare in household thy dispence; A true servant doth more diligence Thy good to keep, than doth thine owen wife, For she will claim a half part all her life. And if that thou be sick, so God me save, Thy very friendes, or a true knave, Will keep thee bet than she, that waiteth aye After thy good, and hath done many a day.\" This sentence, and a hundred times worse, Writeth this man, there God his bones curse. But take no keep of all such vanity, Defy Theophrast, and hearken to me. \\t A wife is Godde\\'s gifte verily; All other manner giftes hardily, As handes, rentes, pasture, or commune, Or mebles, all be giftes of fortune, That passen as a shadow on the wall: But dread thou not, if plainly speak I shall, A wife will last, and in thine house endure, Well longer than thee list, paraventure. Marriage is a full great sacrament; He which that hath no wife, I hold him shent; He liveth helpless, and all desolate (I speak of folk in secular estate): And hearken why, I say not this for nought, -- That woman is for manne\\'s help y-wrought. The highe God, when he had Adam maked, And saw him all alone belly naked, God of his greate goodness saide then, Let us now make a help unto this man Like to himself; and then he made him Eve. Here may ye see, and hereby may ye preve, That a wife is man s help and his comfort, His paradise terrestre and his disport. So buxom and so virtuous is she, They muste needes live in unity; One flesh they be, and one blood, as I guess, With but one heart in weal and in distress. A wife? Ah! Saint Mary, ben\\'dicite, How might a man have any adversity That hath a wife? certes I cannot say The bliss the which that is betwixt them tway, There may no tongue it tell, or hearte think. If he be poor, she helpeth him to swink; She keeps his good, and wasteth never a deal; All that her husband list, her liketh well; She saith not ones Nay, when he saith Yea; \"Do this,\" saith he; \"All ready, Sir,\" saith she. O blissful order, wedlock precious! Thou art so merry, and eke so virtuous, And so commended and approved eke, That every man that holds him worth a leek Upon his bare knees ought all his life To thank his God, that him hath sent a wife; Or elles pray to God him for to send A wife, to last unto his life\\'s end. For then his life is set in sickerness, He may not be deceived, as I guess, So that he work after his wife\\'s rede; Then may he boldely bear up his head, They be so true, and therewithal so wise. For which, if thou wilt worken as the wise, Do alway so as women will thee rede.  Lo how that Jacob, as these clerkes read, By good counsel of his mother Rebecc\\' Bounde the kiddes skin about his neck; For which his father\\'s benison he wan. Lo Judith, as the story telle can, By good counsel she Godde\\'s people kept, And slew him, Holofernes, while he slept. Lo Abigail, by good counsel, how she Saved her husband Nabal, when that he Should have been slain. By counsel good deliver\\'d out of woe The people of God, and made him, Mardoche, Of Assuere enhanced for to be. There is nothing in gree superlative (As saith Senec) above a humble wife. Suffer thy wife\\'s tongue, as Cato bit; She shall command, and thou shalt suffer it, And yet she will obey of courtesy. A wife is keeper of thine husbandry: Well may the sicke man bewail and weep, There as there is no wife the house to keep. I warne thee, if wisely thou wilt wirch, Love well thy wife, as Christ loveth his church: Thou lov\\'st thyself, if thou lovest thy wife. No man hateth his flesh, but in his life He fost\\'reth it; and therefore bid I thee Cherish thy wife, or thou shalt never the. Husband and wife, what so men jape or play, Of worldly folk holde the sicker way; and jeer They be so knit there may no harm betide, And namely upon the wife\\'s side. \\t For whi'),\n",

I pray you, cousin, wisely that ye ride: Governe you also of your diet Attemperly, and namely in this heat. Betwixt us two needeth no strange fare; Farewell, cousin, God shielde you from care.

       "  'stly for to see. And thereout came a rage and such a vise, That it made all the gates for to rise. The northern light in at the doore shone, For window on the walle was there none Through which men mighten any light discern. The doors were all of adamant etern, Y-clenched overthwart and ende-long With iron tough, and, for to make it strong, Every pillar the temple to sustain Was tunne-great, of iron bright and sheen. There saw I first the dark imagining Of felony, and all the compassing; The cruel ire, as red as any glede, The picke-purse, and eke the pale dread; The smiler with the knife under the cloak, The shepen burning with the blacke smoke The treason of the murd\\'ring in the bed, The open war, with woundes all be-bled; Conteke with bloody knife, and sharp menace. All full of chirking was that sorry place. The slayer of himself eke saw I there, His hearte-blood had bathed all his hair: The nail y-driven in the shode at night, The colde death, with mouth gaping upright. Amiddes of the temple sat Mischance, With discomfort and sorry countenance; Eke saw I Woodness laughing in his rage, Armed Complaint, Outhees, and fierce Outrage; The carrain in the bush, with throat y-corve, A thousand slain, and not of qualm y-storve; The tyrant, with the prey by force y-reft; The town destroy\\'d, that there was nothing left. Yet saw I brent the shippes hoppesteres,  The hunter strangled with the wilde bears: The sow freting the child right in the cradle; The cook scalded, for all his longe ladle. Nor was forgot, by th\\'infortune of Mart The carter overridden with his cart; Under the wheel full low he lay adown. There were also of Mars\\' division, The armourer, the bowyer, and the smith, That forgeth sharp swordes on his stith. And all above depainted in a tower Saw I Conquest, sitting in great honour, With thilke sharpe sword over his head Hanging by a subtle y-twined thread. Painted the slaughter was of Julius, Of cruel Nero, and Antonius: Although at that time they were yet unborn, Yet was their death depainted there beforn, By menacing of Mars, right by figure, So was it showed in that portraiture, As is depainted in the stars above, Who shall be slain, or elles dead for love. Sufficeth one ensample in stories old, I may not reckon them all, though I wo\\'ld. \\t The statue of Mars upon a carte stood Armed, and looked grim as he were wood, And over his head there shone two figures Of starres, that be cleped in scriptures, That one Puella, that other Rubeus.  This god of armes was arrayed thus: A wolf there stood before him at his feet With eyen red, and of a man he eat: With subtle pencil painted was this story, In redouting of Mars and of his glory. \\t Now to the temple of Dian the chaste As shortly as I can I will me haste, To telle you all the descriptioun. Depainted be the walles up and down Of hunting and of shamefast chastity. There saw I how woful Calistope, When that Dian aggrieved was with her, Was turned from a woman to a bear, And after was she made the lodestar: Thus was it painted, I can say no far; Her son is eke a star as men may see. There saw I Dane  turn\\'d into a tree, I meane not the goddess Diane, But Peneus\\' daughter, which that hight Dane. There saw I Actaeon an hart y-maked, For vengeance that he saw Dian all naked: I saw how that his houndes have him caught, And freten him, for that they knew him not. Yet painted was, a little farthermore How Atalanta hunted the wild boar; And Meleager, and many other mo\\', For which Diana wrought them care and woe. There saw I many another wondrous story, The which me list not drawen to memory. This goddess on an hart full high was set, With smalle houndes all about her feet, And underneath her feet she had a moon, Waxing it was, and shoulde wane soon. In gaudy green her statue clothed was, With bow in hand, and arrows in a case. Her eyen caste she full low adown, Where Pluto hath his darke regioun. A woman travailing was her beforn, But, for her child so longe was unborn, Full piteously Lucina  gan she call, And saide; \"Help, for thou may\\'st best of all.\" Well could he painte lifelike that it wrought; With many a florin he the hues had bought. Now be these listes made, and Theseus, That at his greate cost arrayed thus The temples, and the theatre every deal, When it was done, him liked wonder well. \\t But stint I will of Theseus a lite, And speak of Palamon and of Arcite. The day approacheth of their returning, That evereach an hundred knights should bring, The battle to darraine as I you told; And to Athens, their covenant to hold, Hath ev\\'reach of them brought an hundred knights, Well-armed for the war at alle rights. And sickerly there trowed many a man, That never, sithen that the world began, For to speaken of knighthood of their hand, As far as God hath maked sea and land, Was, of so few, so noble a company. For every wight that loved chivalry, And would, his thankes, have a passant name, Had prayed, that he might be of that game, And well was him, that thereto chosen was. For if there fell to-morrow such a case, Ye knowe well, that every lusty knight, That loveth par amour, and hath his might Were it in Engleland, or elleswhere, They would, their thankes, willen to be there, T\\' fight for a lady; Benedicite, It were a lusty sighte for to see. And right so fared they with Palamon; With him there wente knightes many one. Some will be armed in an habergeon, And in a breast-plate, and in a gipon; And some will have a pair of plates large; And some will have a Prusse shield, or targe; Some will be armed on their legges weel; Some have an axe, and some a mace of steel. There is no newe guise, but it was old. Armed they weren, as I have you told, Evereach after his opinion. There may\\'st thou see coming with Palamon Licurgus himself, the great king of Thrace: Black was his beard, and manly was his face. The circles of his eyen in his head They glowed betwixte yellow and red, And like a griffin looked he about, With kemped haires on his browes stout; His limbs were great, his brawns were hard and strong, His shoulders broad, his armes round and long. And as the guise was in his country, Full high upon a car of gold stood he, With foure white bulles in the trace. Instead of coat-armour on his harness, With yellow nails, and bright as any gold, He had a beare\\'s skin, coal-black for old. His long hair was y-kempt behind his back, As any raven\\'s feather it shone for black. A wreath of gold arm-great, of huge weight, Upon his head sate, full of stones bright, Of fine rubies and clear diamants. About his car there wente white alauns, Twenty and more, as great as any steer, To hunt the lion or the wilde bear, And follow\\'d him, with muzzle fast y-bound, Collars of gold, and torettes filed round. An hundred lordes had he in his rout Armed full well, with heartes stern and stout. \\t With Arcita, in stories as men find, The great Emetrius the king of Ind, Upon a steede bay trapped in steel, Cover\\'d with cloth of gold diapred well, Came riding like the god of armes, Mars. His coat-armour was of a cloth of Tars, Couched with pearls white and round and great His saddle was of burnish\\'d gold new beat; A mantelet on his shoulders hanging, Bretful of rubies red, as fire sparkling. His crispe hair like ringes was y-run, And that was yellow, glittering as the sun. His nose was high, his eyen bright citrine, His lips were round, his colour was sanguine, A fewe fracknes in his face y-sprent, Betwixte yellow and black somedeal y-ment And as a lion he his looking cast Of five and twenty year his age I cast His beard was well begunnen for to spring; His voice was as a trumpet thundering. Upon his head he wore of laurel green A garland fresh and lusty to be seen; Upon his hand he bare, for his delight, An eagle tame, as any lily white. An hundred lordes had he with him there, All armed, save their heads, in all their gear, Full richely in alle manner things. For trust ye well, that earles, dukes, and kings Were gather\\'d in this noble company, For love, and for increase of chivalry. About this king there ran on every part Full many a tame lion and leopart. And in this wise these lordes all and some Be on the Sunday to the city come Aboute prime, and in the town alight. \\t This Theseus, this Duke, this worthy knight When he had brought them into his city, And inned them, ev\\'reach at his degree, He feasteth them, and doth so great labour To easen them, and do them all honour, That yet men weene that no mannes wit Of none estate could amenden it. The minstrelsy, the service at the feast, The greate giftes to the most and least, The rich array of Theseus\\' palace, Nor who sate first or last upon the dais. What ladies fairest be, or best dancing Or which of them can carol best or sing, Or who most feelingly speaketh of love; What hawkes sitten on the perch above, What houndes liggen on the floor adown, Of all this now make I no mentioun But of th\\'effect; that thinketh me the best Now comes the point, and hearken if you lest. \\t The Sunday night, ere day began to spring, When Palamon the larke hearde sing, Although it were not day by houres two, Yet sang the lark, and Palamon right tho With holy heart, and with an high courage, Arose, to wenden on his pilgrimage Unto the blissful Cithera benign, I meane Venus, honourable and digne. And in her hour  he walketh forth a pace Unto the listes, where her temple was, And down he kneeleth, and with humble cheer And hearte sore, he said as ye shall hear. \\t \"Fairest of fair, O lady mine Venus, Daughter to Jove, and spouse of Vulcanus, Thou gladder of the mount of Citheron! For thilke love thou haddest to Adon  Have pity on my bitter teares smart, And take mine humble prayer to thine heart. Alas! I have no language to tell Th\\'effecte, nor the torment of mine hell; Mine hearte may mine harmes not betray; I am so confused, that I cannot say. But mercy, lady bright, that knowest well My thought, and seest what harm that I feel. Consider all this, and rue upon my sore, As wisly as I shall for evermore Enforce my might, thy true servant to be, And holde war alway with chastity: That make I mine avow, so ye me help. I keepe not of armes for to yelp, Nor ask I not to-morrow to have victory, Nor renown in this case, nor vaine glory Of prize of armes, blowing up and down, But I would have fully possessioun Of Emily, and die in her service; Find thou the manner how, and in what wise. I recke not but it may better be To have vict\\'ry of them, or they of me, So that I have my lady in mine arms. For though so be that Mars is god of arms, Your virtue is so great in heaven above, That, if you list, I shall well have my love. Thy temple will I worship evermo\\', And on thine altar, where I ride or go, I will do sacrifice, and fires bete. And if ye will not so, my lady sweet, Then pray I you, to-morrow with a spear That Arcita me through the hearte bear Then reck I not, when I have lost my life, Though that Arcita win her to his wife. This is th\\' effect and end of my prayere, -- Give me my love, thou blissful lady dear.\" When th\\' orison was done of Palamon, His sacrifice he did, and that anon, Full piteously, with alle circumstances, All tell I not as now his observances.

This multiplying blint so many a one, That in good faith I trowe that it be The cause greatest of such scarcity. These philosophers speak so mistily In this craft, that men cannot come thereby, For any wit that men have how-a-days. They may well chatter, as do these jays, And in their termes set their lust and pain, But to their purpose shall they ne\\'er attain. A man may lightly learn, if he have aught, To multiply, and bring his good to naught. Lo, such a lucre is in this lusty game; A manne\\'s mirth it will turn all to grame, And empty also great and heavy purses, And make folke for to purchase curses Of them that have thereto their good y-lent. Oh, fy for shame! they that have been brent, Alas! can they not flee the fire\\'s heat? Ye that it use, I rede that ye it lete, Lest ye lose all; for better than never is late; Never to thrive, were too long a date. Though ye prowl aye, ye shall it never find; Ye be as bold as is Bayard the blind, That blunders forth, and peril casteth none; He is as bold to run against a stone, As for to go beside it in the way: So fare ye that multiply, I say. If that your eyen cannot see aright, Look that your minde lacke not his sight. For though you look never so broad, and stare, Ye shall not win a mite on that chaffare, But wasten all that ye may rape and renn. Withdraw the fire, lest it too faste brenn; Meddle no more with that art, I mean; For if ye do, your thrift is gone full clean. And right as swithe I will you telle here What philosophers say in this mattere. \\t Lo, thus saith Arnold of the newe town,  As his Rosary maketh mentioun, He saith right thus, withouten any lie; \"There may no man mercury mortify, But it be with his brother\\'s knowledging.\" Lo, how that he, which firste said this thing, Of philosophers father was, Hermes; He saith, how that the dragon doubteless He dieth not, but if that he be slain With his brother. And this is for to sayn, By the dragon, Mercury, and none other, He understood, and Brimstone by his brother, That out of Sol and Luna were y-draw. \"And therefore,\" said he, \"take heed to my saw. Let no man busy him this art to seech, But if that he th\\'intention and speech Of philosophers understande can; And if he do, he is a lewed man. For this science and this conning,\" quoth he, \"Is of the secret of secrets  pardie.\" Also there was a disciple of Plato, That on a time said his master to, As his book, Senior,  will bear witness, And this was his demand in soothfastness: \"Tell me the name of thilke privy stone.\" And Plato answer\\'d unto him anon; \"Take the stone that Titanos men name.\" \"Which is that?\" quoth he. \"Magnesia is the same,\" Saide Plato. \"Yea, Sir, and is it thus? This is ignotum per ignotius.  What is Magnesia, good Sir, I pray?\" \"It is a water that is made, I say, Of th\\' elementes foure,\" quoth Plato. \"Tell me the roote, good Sir,\" quoth he tho, \"Of that water, if that it be your will.\" \"Nay, nay,\" quoth Plato, \"certain that I n\\'ill.

What gift of God had he for all his wives? No man hath such, that in this world alive is. God wot, this noble king, as to my wit, The first night had many a merry fit With each of them, so well was him on live. Blessed be God that I have wedded five! Welcome the sixth whenever that he shall. For since I will not keep me chaste in all, When mine husband is from the world y-gone, Some Christian man shall wedde me anon.

For, hadde God commanded maidenhead, Then had he damned wedding out of dread; And certes, if there were no seed y-sow, Virginity then whereof should it grow? Paul durste not commanden, at the least, A thing of which his Master gave no hest. The dart is set up for virginity; Catch whoso may, who runneth best let see. But this word is not ta\\'en of every wight, But there as God will give it of his might. I wot well that th\\' apostle was a maid, But natheless, although he wrote and said, He would that every wight were such as he, All is but counsel to virginity. And, since to be a wife he gave me leave Of indulgence, so is it no repreve To wedde me, if that my make should die, Without exception of bigamy; All were it good no woman for to touch (He meant as in his bed or in his couch), For peril is both fire and tow t\\'assemble Ye know what this example may resemble.

Full worthy was he in his Lorde's war, And thereto had he ridden, no man farre, As well in Christendom as in Heatheness, And ever honour'd for his worthiness At Alisandre  he was when it was won. Full often time he had the board begun Above alle nations in Prusse. In Lettowe had he reysed, and in Russe, No Christian man so oft of his degree. In Grenade at the siege eke had he be Of Algesir, and ridden in Belmarie.  At Leyes was he, and at Satalie, When they were won; and in the Greate Sea At many a noble army had he be. At mortal battles had he been fifteen, And foughten for our faith at Tramissene. In listes thries, and aye slain his foe. This ilke worthy knight had been also Some time with the lord of Palatie, Against another heathen in Turkie: And evermore he had a sovereign price. And though that he was worthy he was wise, And of his port as meek as is a maid. He never yet no villainy ne said In all his life, unto no manner wight. He was a very perfect gentle knight. But for to telle you of his array, His horse was good, but yet he was not gay. Of fustian he weared a gipon, Alle besmotter'd with his habergeon, For he was late y-come from his voyage, And wente for to do his pilgrimage. \\t With him there was his son, a younge SQUIRE, A lover, and a lusty bacheler, With lockes crulle as they were laid in press. Of twenty year of age he was I guess. Of his stature he was of even length, And wonderly deliver, and great of strength. And he had been some time in chevachie, In Flanders, in Artois, and Picardie, And borne him well, as of so little space, In hope to standen in his lady's grace. Embroider'd was he, as it were a mead All full of freshe flowers, white and red. Singing he was, or fluting all the day; He was as fresh as is the month of May. Short was his gown, with sleeves long and wide. Well could he sit on horse, and faire ride. He coulde songes make, and well indite, Joust, and eke dance, and well pourtray and write. So hot he loved, that by nightertale He slept no more than doth the nightingale. Courteous he was, lowly, and serviceable, And carv'd before his father at the table. \\t A YEOMAN had he, and servants no mo' At that time, for him list ride so And he was clad in coat and hood of green. A sheaf of peacock arrows bright and keen Under his belt he bare full thriftily.

And therefore at the kinge\\'s court, my brother, Each man for himselfe, there is no Love if thee list; for I love and aye shall And soothly, leve brother, this is all. Here in this prison musten we endure, And each of us take his Aventure.\" \\t Great was the strife and long between these tway, If that I hadde leisure for to say; But to the effect: it happen\\'d on a day (To tell it you as shortly as I may), A worthy duke that hight Perithous That fellow was to the Duke Theseus Since thilke day that they were children lite Was come to Athens, his fellow to visite, And for to play, as he was wont to do; For in this world he loved no man so; And he lov\\'d him as tenderly again. So well they lov\\'d, as olde bookes sayn, That when that one was dead, soothly to sayn, His fellow went and sought him down in hell: But of that story list me not to write. Duke Perithous loved well Arcite, And had him known at Thebes year by year: And finally at request and prayere Of Perithous, withoute ranson Duke Theseus him let out of prison, Freely to go, where him list over all, In such a guise, as I you tellen shall This was the forword, plainly to indite, Betwixte Theseus and him Arcite: That if so were, that Arcite were y-found Ever in his life, by day or night, one stound In any country of this Theseus, And he were caught, it was accorded thus, That with a sword he shoulde lose his head; There was none other remedy nor rede. But took his leave, and homeward he him sped; Let him beware, his necke lieth to wed. \\t How great a sorrow suff\\'reth now Arcite! The death he feeleth through his hearte smite; He weepeth, waileth, crieth piteously; To slay himself he waiteth privily. He said; \"Alas the day that I was born! Now is my prison worse than beforn: Now is me shape eternally to dwell Not in purgatory, but right in hell. Alas! that ever I knew Perithous. For elles had I dwelt with Theseus Y-fettered in his prison evermo\\'. Then had I been in bliss, and not in woe. Only the sight of her, whom that I serve, Though that I never may her grace deserve, Would have sufficed right enough for me. O deare cousin Palamon,\" quoth he, \"Thine is the vict\\'ry of this aventure, Full blissfully in prison to endure: In prison? nay certes, in paradise. Well hath fortune y-turned thee the dice, That hast the sight of her, and I th\\' absence. For possible is, since thou hast her presence, And art a knight, a worthy and an able, That by some cas, since fortune is changeable, Thou may\\'st to thy desire sometime attain. But I that am exiled, and barren Of alle grace, and in so great despair, That there n\\'is earthe, water, fire, nor air, Nor creature, that of them maked is, That may me helpe nor comfort in this, Well ought I sterve in wanhope and distress. Farewell my life, my lust, and my gladness. Alas, why plainen men so in commune Of purveyance of God, or of Fortune, That giveth them full oft in many a guise Well better than they can themselves devise? Some man desireth for to have richess, That cause is of his murder or great sickness. And some man would out of his prison fain, That in his house is of his meinie slain. Infinite harmes be in this mattere. We wot never what thing we pray for here. We fare as he that drunk is as a mouse. A drunken man wot well he hath an house, But he wot not which is the right way thither, And to a drunken man the way is slither. And certes in this world so fare we. We seeke fast after felicity, But we go wrong full often truely. Thus we may sayen all, and namely I, That ween\\'d, and had a great opinion, That if I might escape from prison Then had I been in joy and perfect heal, Where now I am exiled from my weal. Since that I may not see you, Emily, I am but dead; there is no remedy.\" \\t Upon that other side, Palamon, When that he wist Arcita was agone, Much sorrow maketh, that the greate tower Resounded of his yelling and clamour The pure fetters on his shinnes great Were of his bitter salte teares wet. \\t \"Alas!\" quoth he, \"Arcita, cousin mine, Of all our strife, God wot, the fruit is thine. Thou walkest now in Thebes at thy large, And of my woe thou givest little charge. Thou mayst, since thou hast wisdom and manhead, Assemble all the folk of our kindred, And make a war so sharp on this country That by some aventure, or some treaty, Thou mayst have her to lady and to wife, For whom that I must needes lose my life. For as by way of possibility, Since thou art at thy large, of prison free, And art a lord, great is thine avantage, More than is mine, that sterve here in a cage. For I must weep and wail, while that I live, With all the woe that prison may me give, And eke with pain that love me gives also, That doubles all my torment and my woe.\" \\t Therewith the fire of jealousy upstart Within his breast, and hent him by the heart So woodly, that he like was to behold The box-tree, or the ashes dead and cold. Then said; \"O cruel goddess, that govern This world with binding of your word etern And writen in the table of adamant Your parlement and your eternal grant, What is mankind more unto you y-hold Than is the sheep, that rouketh in the fold! For slain is man, right as another beast; And dwelleth eke in prison and arrest, And hath sickness, and great adversity, And oftentimes guilteless, pardie What governance is in your prescience, That guilteless tormenteth innocence? And yet increaseth this all my penance, That man is bounden to his observance For Godde\\'s sake to letten of his will, Whereas a beast may all his lust fulfil. And when a beast is dead, he hath no pain; But man after his death must weep and plain, Though in this worlde he have care and woe: Withoute doubt it maye standen so. \"The answer of this leave I to divines, But well I wot, that in this world great pine is; Alas! I see a serpent or a thief That many a true man hath done mischief, Go at his large, and where him list may turn. But I must be in prison through Saturn, And eke through Juno, jealous and eke wood, That hath well nigh destroyed all the blood Of Thebes, with his waste walles wide. And Venus slay\\'th me on that other side For jealousy, and fear of him, Arcite.\" \\t Now will I stent of Palamon a lite, And let him in his prison stille dwell, And of Arcita forth I will you tell. The summer passeth, and the nightes long Increase double-wise the paines strong Both of the lover and the prisonere. I n\\'ot which hath the wofuller mistere. For, shortly for to say, this Palamon Perpetually is damned to prison, In chaines and in fetters to be dead; And Arcite is exiled on his head For evermore as out of that country, Nor never more he shall his lady see. You lovers ask I now this question, Who lieth the worse, Arcite or Palamon? The one may see his lady day by day, But in prison he dwelle must alway. The other where him list may ride or go, But see his lady shall he never mo\\'. Now deem all as you liste, ye that can, For I will tell you forth as I began. \\t When that Arcite to Thebes comen was, Full oft a day he swelt, and said, \"Alas!\" For see this lady he shall never mo\\'. And shortly to concluden all his woe, So much sorrow had never creature That is or shall be while the world may dure. His sleep, his meat, his drink is him byraft, That lean he wex, and dry as any shaft. His eyen hollow, grisly to behold, His hue sallow, and pale as ashes cold, And solitary he was, ever alone, And wailing all the night, making his moan. And if he hearde song or instrument, Then would he weepen, he might not be stent. So feeble were his spirits, and so low, And changed so, that no man coulde know His speech, neither his voice, though men it heard. And in his gear for all the world he far\\'d Not only like the lovers\\' malady Of Eros, but rather y-like manie Engender\\'d of humours melancholic, Before his head in his cell fantastic. And shortly turned was all upside down, Both habit and eke dispositioun, Of him, this woful lover Dan Arcite. Why should I all day of his woe indite? When he endured had a year or two This cruel torment, and this pain and woe, At Thebes, in his country, as I said, Upon a night in sleep as he him laid, Him thought how that the winged god Mercury Before him stood, and bade him to be merry. His sleepy yard in hand he bare upright; A hat he wore upon his haires bright. Arrayed was this god (as he took keep) As he was when that Argus took his sleep; And said him thus: \"To Athens shalt thou wend; There is thee shapen of thy woe an end.\" And with that word Arcite woke and start. \"Now truely how sore that e\\'er me smart,\" Quoth he, \"to Athens right now will I fare. Nor for no dread of death shall I not spare To see my lady that I love and serve; In her presence I recke not to sterve.\" And with that word he caught a great mirror, And saw that changed was all his colour, And saw his visage all in other kind. And right anon it ran him ill his mind, That since his face was so disfigur\\'d Of malady the which he had endur\\'d, He mighte well, if that he bare him low, Live in Athenes evermore unknow, And see his lady wellnigh day by day. And right anon he changed his array, And clad him as a poore labourer. And all alone, save only a squier, That knew his privity and all his cas, Which was disguised poorly as he was, To Athens is he gone the nexte way. And to the court he went upon a day, And at the gate he proffer\\'d his service, To drudge and draw, what so men would devise. And, shortly of this matter for to sayn, He fell in office with a chamberlain, The which that dwelling was with Emily. For he was wise, and coulde soon espy Of every servant which that served her.

The cleanness and the fasting of us freres Maketh that Christ accepteth our prayeres. Lo, Moses forty days and forty night Fasted, ere that the high God full of might Spake with him in the mountain of Sinai: With empty womb of fasting many a day Received he the lawe, that was writ With Godde\\'s finger; and Eli, well ye wit, In Mount Horeb, ere he had any speech With highe God, that is our live\\'s leech, He fasted long, and was in contemplance. Aaron, that had the temple in governance, And eke the other priestes every one, Into the temple when they shoulde gon To praye for the people, and do service, They woulde drinken in no manner wise No drinke, which that might them drunken make, But there in abstinence pray and wake, Lest that they died: take heed what I say -- But they be sober that for the people pray -- Ware that, I say -- no more: for it sufficeth. Our Lord Jesus, as Holy Writ deviseth, Gave us example of fasting and prayeres: Therefore we mendicants, we sely freres, Be wedded to povert\\' and continence, To charity, humbless, and abstinence, To persecution for righteousness, To weeping, misericorde, and to cleanness.

And one thing would I pray you of your grace, But if my lord forbade you at the least, Bury this little body in some place, That neither beasts nor birdes it arace.\" But he no word would to that purpose say, But took the child and went upon his way. \\t The sergeant came unto his lord again, And of Griselda\\'s words and of her cheer He told him point for point, in short and plain, And him presented with his daughter dear. Somewhat this lord had ruth in his mannere, But natheless his purpose held he still, As lordes do, when they will have their will; \\t And bade this sergeant that he privily Shoulde the child full softly wind and wrap, With alle circumstances tenderly, And carry it in a coffer, or in lap; But, upon pain his head off for to swap, That no man shoulde know of his intent, Nor whence he came, nor whither that he went; \\t But at Bologna, to his sister dear, That at that time of Panic\\' was Countess, He should it take, and shew her this mattere, Beseeching her to do her business This child to foster in all gentleness, And whose child it was he bade her hide From every wight, for aught that might betide. \\t The sergeant went, and hath fulfill\\'d this thing. But to the marquis now returne we; For now went he full fast imagining If by his wife\\'s cheer he mighte see, Or by her wordes apperceive, that she Were changed; but he never could her find, But ever-in-one alike sad and kind. \\t As glad, as humble, as busy in service, And eke in love, as she was wont to be, Was she to him, in every manner wise; And of her daughter not a word spake she; No accident for no adversity Was seen in her, nor e\\'er her daughter\\'s name She named, or in earnest or in game. \\t \\t Pars Quarta \\t \\t In this estate there passed be four year Ere she with childe was; but, as God wo\\'ld, A knave child she bare by this Waltere, Full gracious and fair for to behold; And when that folk it to his father told, Not only he, but all his country, merry Were for this child, and God they thank and hery. \\t When it was two year old, and from the breast Departed of the norice, on a day This marquis caughte yet another lest To tempt his wife yet farther, if he may.

Here may ye see, how excellent franchise In women is when they them narrow advise. Some tyrant is, -- as there be many a one, -- That hath a heart as hard as any stone, Which would have let him sterven in the place Well rather than have granted him her grace; And then rejoicen in her cruel pride. And reckon not to be a homicide. This gentle May, full filled of pity, Right of her hand a letter maked she, In which she granted him her very grace; There lacked nought, but only day and place, Where that she might unto his lust suffice: For it shall be right as he will devise. And when she saw her time upon a day To visit this Damian went this May, And subtilly this letter down she thrust Under his pillow, read it if him lust. She took him by the hand, and hard him twist So secretly, that no wight of it wist, And bade him be all whole; and forth she went To January, when he for her sent. Up rose Damian the nexte morrow, All passed was his sickness and his sorrow. He combed him, he proined  him and picked, He did all that unto his lady liked; And eke to January he went as low As ever did a dogge for the bow. He is so pleasant unto every man (For craft is all, whoso that do it can), Every wight is fain to speak him good; And fully in his lady\\'s grace he stood. Thus leave I Damian about his need, And in my tale forth I will proceed. \\t Some clerke holde that felicity Stands in delight; and therefore certain he, This noble January, with all his might In honest wise as longeth to a knight, Shope him to live full deliciously: His housing, his array, as honestly To his degree was maked as a king\\'s. Amonges other of his honest things He had a garden walled all with stone; So fair a garden wot I nowhere none. For out of doubt I verily suppose That he that wrote the Romance of the Rose  Could not of it the beauty well devise; Nor Priapus  mighte not well suffice, Though he be god of gardens, for to tell The beauty of the garden, and the well That stood under a laurel always green. Full often time he, Pluto, and his queen Proserpina, and all their faerie, Disported them and made melody About that well, and danced, as men told. This noble knight, this January old Such dainty had in it to walk and play, That he would suffer no wight to bear the key, Save he himself, for of the small wicket He bare always of silver a cliket, With which, when that him list, he it unshet. And when that he would pay his wife\\'s debt, In summer season, thither would he go, And May his wife, and no wight but they two; And thinges which that were not done in bed, He in the garden them perform\\'d and sped. And in this wise many a merry day Lived this January and fresh May, But worldly joy may not always endure To January, nor to no creatucere. \\t O sudden hap! O thou fortune unstable! Like to the scorpion so deceivable, That fhatt\\'rest with thy head when thou wilt sting; Thy tail is death, through thine envenoming. O brittle joy! O sweete poison quaint! O monster, that so subtilly canst paint Thy giftes, under hue of steadfastness, That thou deceivest bothe more and less! Why hast thou January thus deceiv\\'d, That haddest him for thy full friend receiv\\'d? And now thou hast bereft him both his eyen, For sorrow of which desireth he to dien. Alas! this noble January free, Amid his lust and his prosperity Is waxen blind, and that all suddenly. He weeped and he wailed piteously; And therewithal the fire of jealousy (Lest that his wife should fall in some folly) So burnt his hearte, that he woulde fain, That some man bothe him and her had slain; For neither after his death, nor in his life, Ne would he that she were no love nor wife, But ever live as widow in clothes black, Sole as the turtle that hath lost her make. But at the last, after a month or tway, His sorrow gan assuage, soothe to say. For, when he wist it might none other be, He patiently took his adversity: Save out of doubte he may not foregon That he was jealous evermore-in-one: Which jealousy was so outrageous, That neither in hall, nor in none other house, Nor in none other place never the mo\\' He woulde suffer her to ride or go, But if that he had hand on her alway. For which full often wepte freshe May, That loved Damian so burningly That she must either dien suddenly, Or elles she must have him as her lest: She waited when her hearte woulde brest. Upon that other side Damian Becomen is the sorrowfullest man That ever was; for neither night nor day He mighte speak a word to freshe May, As to his purpose, of no such mattere, But if that January must it hear, That had a hand upon her evermo\\'.

Full many a riche country had he won. What with his wisdom and his chivalry, He conquer\\'d all the regne of Feminie, That whilom was y-cleped Scythia; And weddede the Queen Hippolyta And brought her home with him to his country With muchel glory and great solemnity, And eke her younge sister Emily, And thus with vict\\'ry and with melody Let I this worthy Duke to Athens ride, And all his host, in armes him beside. \\t And certes, if it n\\'ere too long to hear, I would have told you fully the mannere, How wonnen was the regne of Feminie,  By Theseus, and by his chivalry; And of the greate battle for the nonce Betwixt Athenes and the Amazons; And how assieged was Hippolyta, The faire hardy queen of Scythia; And of the feast that was at her wedding And of the tempest at her homecoming. But all these things I must as now forbear. I have, God wot, a large field to ear And weake be the oxen in my plough; The remnant of my tale is long enow. I will not letten eke none of this rout. Let every fellow tell his tale about, And let see now who shall the supper win. There as I left, I will again begin. \\t This Duke, of whom I make mentioun, When he was come almost unto the town, In all his weal, and in his moste pride, He was ware, as he cast his eye aside, Where that there kneeled in the highe way A company of ladies, tway and tway, Each after other, clad in clothes black: But such a cry and such a woe they make, That in this world n\\'is creature living, That hearde such another waimenting And of this crying would they never stenten, Till they the reines of his bridle henten. \"What folk be ye that at mine homecoming Perturben so my feaste with crying?\" Quoth Theseus; \"Have ye so great envy Of mine honour, that thus complain and cry? Or who hath you misboden, or offended? Do telle me, if it may be amended; And why that ye be clad thus all in black?\" \\t The oldest lady of them all then spake, When she had swooned, with a deadly cheer, That it was ruthe for to see or hear. She saide; \"Lord, to whom fortune hath given Vict\\'ry, and as a conqueror to liven, Nought grieveth us your glory and your honour; But we beseechen mercy and succour. Have mercy on our woe and our distress; Some drop of pity, through thy gentleness, Upon us wretched women let now fall. For certes, lord, there is none of us all That hath not been a duchess or a queen; Now be we caitives, as it is well seen: Thanked be Fortune, and her false wheel, That none estate ensureth to be wele. And certes, lord, t\\'abiden your presence Here in this temple of the goddess Clemence We have been waiting all this fortenight: Now help us, lord, since it lies in thy might. \\t \"I, wretched wight, that weep and waile thus, Was whilom wife to king Capaneus, That starf at Thebes, cursed be that day: And alle we that be in this array, And maken all this lamentatioun, We losten all our husbands at that town, While that the siege thereabouten lay. And yet the olde Creon, wellaway! That lord is now of Thebes the city, Fulfilled of ire and of iniquity, He for despite, and for his tyranny, To do the deade bodies villainy, Of all our lorde\\'s, which that been y-slaw, Hath all the bodies on an heap y-draw, And will not suffer them by none assent Neither to be y-buried, nor y-brent, But maketh houndes eat them in despite.\" And with that word, withoute more respite They fallen groff, and cryden piteously; \"Have on us wretched women some mercy, And let our sorrow sinken in thine heart.\" \\t This gentle Duke down from his courser start With hearte piteous, when he heard them speak. Him thoughte that his heart would all to-break, When he saw them so piteous and so mate That whilom weren of so great estate. And in his armes he them all up hent, And them comforted in full good intent, And swore his oath, as he was true knight, He woulde do so farforthly his might Upon the tyrant Creon them to wreak, That all the people of Greece shoulde speak, How Creon was of Theseus y-served, As he that had his death full well deserved. And right anon withoute more abode His banner he display\\'d, and forth he rode To Thebes-ward, and all his, host beside: No ner Athenes would he go nor ride, Nor take his ease fully half a day, But onward on his way that night he lay: And sent anon Hippolyta the queen, And Emily her younge sister sheen Unto the town of Athens for to dwell: And forth he rit; there is no more to tell. \\t The red statue of Mars with spear and targe So shineth in his white banner large That all the fieldes glitter up and down: And by his banner borne is his pennon Of gold full rich, in which there was y-beat The Minotaur which that he slew in Crete Thus rit this Duke, thus rit this conqueror And in his host of chivalry the flower, Till that he came to Thebes, and alight Fair in a field, there as he thought to fight. But shortly for to speaken of this thing, With Creon, which that was of Thebes king, He fought, and slew him manly as a knight In plain bataille, and put his folk to flight: And by assault he won the city after, And rent adown both wall, and spar, and rafter; And to the ladies he restored again The bodies of their husbands that were slain, To do obsequies, as was then the guise. \\t But it were all too long for to devise The greate clamour, and the waimenting, Which that the ladies made at the brenning Of the bodies, and the great honour That Theseus the noble conqueror Did to the ladies, when they from him went: But shortly for to tell is mine intent. When that this worthy Duke, this Theseus, Had Creon slain, and wonnen Thebes thus, Still in the field he took all night his rest, And did with all the country as him lest. To ransack in the tas of bodies dead, Them for to strip of harness and of weed, The pillers did their business and cure, After the battle and discomfiture. And so befell, that in the tas they found, Through girt with many a grievous bloody wound, Two younge knightes ligging by and by Both in one armes, wrought full richely: Of whiche two, Arcita hight that one, And he that other highte Palamon. Not fully quick, nor fully dead they were, But by their coat-armour, and by their gear, The heralds knew them well in special, As those that weren of the blood royal Of Thebes, and of sistren two y-born. Out of the tas the pillers have them torn, And have them carried soft unto the tent Of Theseus, and he full soon them sent To Athens, for to dwellen in prison Perpetually, he n\\'olde no ranson. And when this worthy Duke had thus y-done, He took his host, and home he rit anon With laurel crowned as a conquerour; And there he lived in joy and in honour Term of his life; what needeth wordes mo\\'? And in a tower, in anguish and in woe, Dwellen this Palamon, and eke Arcite, For evermore, there may no gold them quite \\t Thus passed year by year, and day by day, Till it fell ones in a morn of May That Emily, that fairer was to seen Than is the lily upon his stalke green, And fresher than the May with flowers new (For with the rose colour strove her hue; I n\\'ot which was the finer of them two), Ere it was day, as she was wont to do, She was arisen, and all ready dight, For May will have no sluggardy a-night; The season pricketh every gentle heart, And maketh him out of his sleep to start, And saith, \"Arise, and do thine observance.\" \\t This maketh Emily have remembrance To do honour to May, and for to rise. Y-clothed was she fresh for to devise; Her yellow hair was braided in a tress, Behind her back, a yarde long I guess. And in the garden at the sun uprist She walketh up and down where as her list. She gathereth flowers, party white and red, To make a sotel garland for her head, And as an angel heavenly she sung. The greate tower, that was so thick and strong, Which of the castle was the chief dungeon (Where as these knightes weren in prison, Of which I tolde you, and telle shall), Was even joinant to the garden wall, There as this Emily had her playing. \\t Bright was the sun, and clear that morrowning, And Palamon, this woful prisoner, As was his wont, by leave of his gaoler, Was ris\\'n, and roamed in a chamber on high, In which he all the noble city sigh, And eke the garden, full of branches green, There as this fresh Emelia the sheen Was in her walk, and roamed up and down. This sorrowful prisoner, this Palamon Went in his chamber roaming to and fro, And to himself complaining of his woe: That he was born, full oft he said, Alas! And so befell, by aventure or cas, That through a window thick of many a bar Of iron great, and square as any spar, He cast his eyes upon Emelia, And therewithal he blent and cried, Ah! As though he stungen were unto the heart. And with that cry Arcite anon up start, And saide, \"Cousin mine, what aileth thee, That art so pale and deadly for to see? Why cried\\'st thou? who hath thee done offence? For Godde\\'s love, take all in patience Our prison, for it may none other be. Fortune hath giv\\'n us this adversity\\'. Some wick\\' aspect or disposition Of Saturn, by some constellation, Hath giv\\'n us this, although we had it sworn, So stood the heaven when that we were born, We must endure; this is the short and plain. \\t This Palamon answer\\'d, and said again: \"Cousin, forsooth of this opinion Thou hast a vain imagination. This prison caused me not for to cry; But I was hurt right now thorough mine eye Into mine heart; that will my bane be. The fairness of the lady that I see Yond in the garden roaming to and fro, Is cause of all my crying and my woe. I n\\'ot wher she be woman or goddess, But Venus is it, soothly as I guess, And therewithal on knees adown he fill, And saide: \"Venus, if it be your will You in this garden thus to transfigure Before me sorrowful wretched creature, Out of this prison help that we may scape. And if so be our destiny be shape By etern word to dien in prison, Of our lineage have some compassion, That is so low y-brought by tyranny.\" \\t And with that word Arcita gan espy Where as this lady roamed to and fro And with that sight her beauty hurt him so, That if that Palamon was wounded sore, Arcite is hurt as much as he, or more. And with a sigh he saide piteously: \"The freshe beauty slay\\'th me suddenly Of her that roameth yonder in the place. And but I have her mercy and her grace, That I may see her at the leaste way, I am but dead; there is no more to say.\" This Palamon, when he these wordes heard, Dispiteously he looked, and answer\\'d: \"Whether say\\'st thou this in earnest or in play?\" \"Nay,\" quoth Arcite, \"in earnest, by my fay. God help me so, me lust full ill to play.\" This Palamon gan knit his browes tway. \"It were,\" quoth he, \"to thee no great honour For to be false, nor for to be traitour To me, that am thy cousin and thy brother Y-sworn full deep, and each of us to other, That never for to dien in the pain , Till that the death departen shall us twain, Neither of us in love to hinder other, Nor in none other case, my leve brother; But that thou shouldest truly farther me In every case, as I should farther thee.

Her over-lippe wiped she so clean, That in her cup there was no farthing seen Of grease, when she drunken had her draught; Full seemely after her meat she raught: And sickerly she was of great disport, And full pleasant, and amiable of port, And pained her to counterfeite cheer Of court, and be estately of mannere, And to be holden digne of reverence. But for to speaken of her conscience, She was so charitable and so pitous, She woulde weep if that she saw a mouse Caught in a trap, if it were dead or bled. Of smalle houndes had she, that she fed With roasted flesh, and milk, and wastel bread. But sore she wept if one of them were dead, Or if men smote it with a yarde smart: And all was conscience and tender heart. Full seemly her wimple y-pinched was; Her nose tretis; her eyen gray as glass; Her mouth full small, and thereto soft and red; But sickerly she had a fair forehead. It was almost a spanne broad I trow; For hardily she was not undergrow. Full fetis was her cloak, as I was ware. Of small coral about her arm she bare A pair of beades, gauded all with green; And thereon hung a brooch of gold full sheen, On which was first y-written a crown'd A, And after, Amor vincit omnia. Another Nun also with her had she, [That was her chapelleine, and PRIESTES three.] \\t A MONK there was, a fair for the mast'ry, An out-rider, that loved venery; A manly man, to be an abbot able. Full many a dainty horse had he in stable: And when he rode, men might his bridle hear Jingeling  in a whistling wind as clear, And eke as loud, as doth the chapel bell, There as this lord was keeper of the cell. The rule of Saint Maur and of Saint Benet,  Because that it was old and somedeal strait This ilke monk let olde thinges pace, And held after the newe world the trace. He gave not of the text a pulled hen, That saith, that hunters be not holy men: Ne that a monk, when he is cloisterless; Is like to a fish that is waterless; This is to say, a monk out of his cloister. This ilke text held he not worth an oyster; And I say his opinion was good. Why should he study, and make himselfe wood Upon a book in cloister always pore, Or swinken with his handes, and labour, As Austin bid? how shall the world be served? Let Austin have his swink to him reserved. Therefore he was a prickasour aright: Greyhounds he had as swift as fowl of flight; Of pricking and of hunting for the hare Was all his lust, for no cost would he spare. I saw his sleeves purfil'd at the hand With gris, and that the finest of the land. And for to fasten his hood under his chin, He had of gold y-wrought a curious pin; A love-knot in the greater end there was. His head was bald, and shone as any glass, And eke his face, as it had been anoint; He was a lord full fat and in good point; His eyen steep, and rolling in his head, That steamed as a furnace of a lead. His bootes supple, his horse in great estate, Now certainly he was a fair prelate; He was not pale as a forpined ghost; A fat swan lov'd he best of any roast. His palfrey was as brown as is a berry. \\t A FRIAR there was, a wanton and a merry, A limitour , a full solemne man. In all the orders four is none that can So much of dalliance and fair language.

O perilous fire, that in the bedstraw breedeth! O foe familiar, that his service bedeth! O servant traitor, O false homely hewe, Like to the adder in bosom shy untrue, God shield us alle from your acquaintance!

Home to their houses lustily they ride, Where as they do their thinges as them lest, And when they see their time they go to rest.

In twenty manners could he trip and dance, After the school of Oxenforde tho, And with his legges caste to and fro; And playen songes on a small ribible; Thereto he sung sometimes a loud quinible And as well could he play on a gitern.

And for his friends upon a day he sent To tell them the effect With face sad, his tale he hath them told: He saide, \"Friendes, I am hoar and old, And almost (God wot) on my pitte\\'s brink, Upon my soule somewhat must I think. I have my body foolishly dispended, Blessed be God that it shall be amended; For I will be certain a wedded man, And that anon in all the haste I can, Unto some maiden, fair and tender of age; I pray you shape for my marriage All suddenly, for I will not abide: And I will fond to espy, on my side, To whom I may be wedded hastily. But forasmuch as ye be more than, Ye shalle rather such a thing espy Than I, and where me best were to ally. But one thing warn I you, my friendes dear, I will none old wife have in no mannere: She shall not passe sixteen year certain. Old fish and younge flesh would I have fain. Better,\" quoth he, \"a pike than a pickerel, And better than old beef is tender veal. I will no woman thirty year of age, It is but beanestraw and great forage. And eke these olde widows (God it wot) They conne so much craft on Wade\\'s boat, So muche brooke harm when that them lest, That with them should I never live in rest. For sundry schooles make subtle clerkes; Woman of many schooles half a clerk is. But certainly a young thing men may guy, Right as men may warm wax with handes ply. Wherefore I say you plainly in a clause, I will none old wife have, right for this cause. For if so were I hadde such mischance, That I in her could have no pleasance, Then should I lead my life in avoutrie, And go straight to the devil when I die. Nor children should I none upon her getten: Yet were me lever houndes had me eaten Than that mine heritage shoulde fall In strange hands: and this I tell you all. I doubte not I know the cause why Men shoulde wed: and farthermore know I There speaketh many a man of marriage That knows no more of it than doth my page, For what causes a man should take a wife. If he ne may not live chaste his life, Take him a wife with great devotion, Because of lawful procreation Of children, to th\\' honour of God above, And not only for paramour or love; And for they shoulde lechery eschew, And yield their debte when that it is due: Or for that each of them should help the other In mischief, as a sister shall the brother, And live in chastity full holily. But, Sires, by your leave, that am not I, For, God be thanked, I dare make avaunt, I feel my limbes stark and suffisant To do all that a man belongeth to: I wot myselfe best what I may do. Though I be hoar, I fare as doth a tree, That blossoms ere the fruit y-waxen be; The blossomy tree is neither dry nor dead; I feel me now here hoar but on my head. Mine heart and all my limbes are as green As laurel through the year is for to seen.

This word said he unto us every one; Work alle thing by counsel, -- thus said he, -- And thenne shalt thou not repente thee But though that Solomon spake such a word, Mine owen deare brother and my lord, So wisly God my soule bring at rest, I hold your owen counsel is the best. For, brother mine, take of me this motive;  I have now been a court-man all my life, And, God it wot, though I unworthy be, I have standen in full great degree Aboute lordes of full high estate; Yet had I ne\\'er with none of them debate; I never them contraried truely. I know well that my lord can more than I; What that he saith I hold it firm and stable, I say the same, or else a thing semblable. A full great fool is any counsellor That serveth any lord of high honour That dare presume, or ones thinken it; That his counsel should pass his lorde\\'s wit. Nay, lordes be no fooles by my fay. Ye have yourselfe shewed here to day So high sentence, so holily and well That I consent, and confirm every deal Your wordes all, and your opinioun By God, there is no man in all this town Nor in Itale, could better have y-said. Christ holds him of this counsel well apaid. And truely it is a high courage Of any man that stopen is in age, To take a young wife, by my father\\'s kin; Your hearte hangeth on a jolly pin. Do now in this matter right as you lest, For finally I hold it for the best.\" \\t Justinus, that aye stille sat and heard, Right in this wise to Placebo answer\\'d. \"Now, brother mine, be patient I pray, Since ye have said, and hearken what I say. Senec, among his other wordes wise, Saith, that a man ought him right well advise, To whom he gives his hand or his chattel.

My will is this, for plain conclusion Withouten any replication, If that you liketh, take it for the best, That evereach of you shall go where him lest, Freely without ransom or danger; And this day fifty weekes, farre ne nerre, Evereach of you shall bring an hundred knights, Armed for listes up at alle rights All ready to darraine her by bataille, And this behete I you withoute fail Upon my troth, and as I am a knight, That whether of you bothe that hath might, That is to say, that whether he or thou May with his hundred, as I spake of now, Slay his contrary, or out of listes drive, Him shall I given Emily to wive, To whom that fortune gives so fair a grace. The listes shall I make here in this place. And God so wisly on my soule rue, As I shall even judge be and true. Ye shall none other ende with me maken Than one of you shalle be dead or taken. And if you thinketh this is well y-said, Say your advice, and hold yourselves apaid. This is your end, and your conclusion.\" Who looketh lightly now but Palamon? Who springeth up for joye but Arcite? Who could it tell, or who could it indite, The joye that is maked in the place When Theseus hath done so fair a grace? But down on knees went every manner wight, And thanked him with all their heartes\\' might, And namely these Thebans ofte sithe. And thus with good hope and with hearte blithe They take their leave, and homeward gan they ride To Thebes-ward, with his old walles wide. \\t I trow men woulde deem it negligence, If I forgot to telle the dispence Of Theseus, that went so busily To maken up the listes royally, That such a noble theatre as it was, I dare well say, in all this world there n\\'as. The circuit a mile was about, Walled of stone, and ditched all without. Round was the shape, in manner of compass, Full of degrees, the height of sixty pas see note That when a man was set on one degree He letted not his fellow for to see. Eastward there stood a gate of marble white, Westward right such another opposite. And, shortly to conclude, such a place Was never on earth made in so little space, For in the land there was no craftes-man, That geometry or arsmetrike can, Nor pourtrayor, nor carver of images, That Theseus ne gave him meat and wages The theatre to make and to devise. And for to do his rite and sacrifice He eastward hath upon the gate above, In worship of Venus, goddess of love, Done make an altar and an oratory; And westward, in the mind and in memory Of Mars, he maked hath right such another, That coste largely of gold a fother. And northward, in a turret on the wall, Of alabaster white and red coral An oratory riche for to see, In worship of Diane of chastity, Hath Theseus done work in noble wise. But yet had I forgotten to devise The noble carving, and the portraitures, The shape, the countenance of the figures That weren in there oratories three. \\t First in the temple of Venus may\\'st thou see Wrought on the wall, The broken sleepes, and the sikes cold, The sacred teares, and the waimentings, The fiery strokes of the desirings, That Love\\'s servants in this life endure; The oathes, that their covenants assure. Pleasance and Hope, Desire, Foolhardiness, Beauty and Youth, and Bawdry and Richess, Charms and Sorc\\'ry, Leasings and Flattery, Dispence, Business, and Jealousy, That wore of yellow goldes a garland, And had a cuckoo sitting on her hand, Feasts, instruments, and caroles and dances, Lust and array, and all the circumstances Of Love, which I reckon\\'d and reckon shall In order, were painted on the wall, And more than I can make of mention. For soothly all the mount of Citheron, Where Venus hath her principal dwelling, Was showed on the wall in pourtraying, With all the garden, and the lustiness. Nor was forgot the porter Idleness, Nor Narcissus the fair of yore agone, Nor yet the folly of King Solomon, Nor yet the greate strength of Hercules, Th\\' enchantments of Medea and Circes, Nor of Turnus the hardy fierce courage, The rich Croesus caitif in servage.  Thus may ye see, that wisdom nor richess, Beauty, nor sleight, nor strength, nor hardiness Ne may with Venus holde champartie, For as her liste the world may she gie. Lo, all these folk so caught were in her las Till they for woe full often said, Alas! Suffice these ensamples one or two, Although I could reckon a thousand mo\\'. \\t The statue of Venus, glorious to see Was naked floating in the large sea, And from the navel down all cover\\'d was With waves green, and bright as any glass. A citole  in her right hand hadde she, And on her head, full seemly for to see, A rose garland fresh, and well smelling, Above her head her doves flickering Before her stood her sone Cupido, Upon his shoulders winges had he two; And blind he was, as it is often seen; A bow he bare, and arrows bright and keen. \\t Why should I not as well eke tell you all The portraiture, that was upon the wall Within the temple of mighty Mars the Red? All painted was the wall in length and brede Like to the estres of the grisly place That hight the great temple of Mars in Thrace, In thilke cold and frosty region, There as Mars hath his sovereign mansion. In which there dwelled neither man nor beast, With knotty gnarry barren trees old Of stubbes sharp and hideous to behold; In which there ran a rumble and a sough, As though a storm should bursten every bough: And downward from an hill under a bent There stood the temple of Mars Armipotent, Wrought all of burnish\\'d steel, of which th\\' entry Was long and strait, and gha'),\n",

Upon a day befell, that he for his disport went into the fields him to play. within his house, of which the doors were fast shut. Three of his old foes have it espied, and set ladders to the walls of his house, and by the windows be entered, and beaten his wife, and wounded his daughter with five mortal wounds, in five sundry places; that is to say, in her feet, in her hands, in her ears, in her nose, and in her mouth; and left her for dead, and went away. When Meliboeus returned was into his house, and saw all this mischief, he, like a man mad, rending his clothes, gan weep and cry. Prudence his wife, as farforth as she durst, besought him of his weeping for to stint: but not forthy [notwithstanding] he gan to weep and cry ever longer the more. \\t This noble wife Prudence remembered her upon the sentence of Ovid, in his book that called is the \"Remedy of Love,\"  where he saith: He is a fool that disturbeth the mother to weep in the death of her child, till she have wept her fill, as for a certain time; and then shall a man do his diligence with amiable words her to recomfort and pray her of her weeping for to stint [cease]. For which reason this noble wife Prudence suffered her husband for to weep and cry, as for a certain space; and when she saw her time, she said to him in this wise: \"Alas! my lord,\" quoth she, \"why make ye yourself for to be like a fool? For sooth it appertaineth not to a wise man to make such a sorrow. Your daughter, with the grace of God, shall warish [be cured] and escape. And all [although] were it so that she right now were dead, ye ought not for her death yourself to destroy. Seneca saith, \\'The wise man shall not take too great discomfort for the death of his children, but certes he should suffer it in patience, as well as he abideth the death of his own proper person.\\'\" \\t Meliboeus answered anon and said: \"What man,\" quoth he, \"should of his weeping stint, that hath so great a cause to weep? Jesus Christ, our Lord, himself wept for the death of Lazarus his friend.\" attempered [moderate] weeping is nothing defended [forbidden] to him that sorrowful is, among folk in sorrow but it is rather granted him to weep. writeth, \\'Man shall rejoice with them that make joy, and weep with such folk as weep.\\' granted, outrageous weeping certes is defended. Measure of weeping should be conserved, teacheth us Seneca. not thine eyes too moist be of tears, nor too much dry: although the tears come to thine eyes, let them not fall. hast forgone [lost] thy friend, do diligence to get again another friend: and this is more wisdom than to weep for thy friend which that thou hast lorn [lost] for therein is no boot [advantage]. away sorrow out of your heart. Remember you that Jesus Sirach saith, \\'A man that is joyous and glad in heart, it him conserveth flourishing in his age: but soothly a sorrowful heart maketh his bones dry.\\' slayth full many a man.\\' Solomon the sheep\\'s fleece annoy [do injury] to the clothes, and the small worms to the tree, right so annoyeth sorrow to the heart of man.\\' Wherefore us ought as well in the death of our children, as in the loss of our goods temporal, have patience. Remember you upon the patient Job, when he had lost his children and his temporal substance, and in his body endured and received full many a grievous tribulation, yet said he thus: \\'Our Lord hath given it to me, our Lord hath bereft it me; right as our Lord would, right so be it done; blessed be the name of our Lord.\"\\' \\t To these foresaid things answered Meliboeus unto his wife Prudence: \"All thy words,\" quoth he, \"be true, and thereto [also] profitable, but truly mine heart is troubled with this sorrow so grievously, that I know not what to do.\" quoth Prudence, \"thy true friends all, and thy lineage, which be wise, and tell to them your case, and hearken what they say in counselling, and govern you after their sentence [opinion]. Solomon saith, \\'Work all things by counsel, and thou shall never repent.\\'\" Then, by counsel of his wife Prudence, this Meliboeus let call [sent for] a great congregation of folk, as surgeons, physicians, old folk and young, and some of his old enemies reconciled (as by their semblance) to his love and to his grace; and therewithal there come some of his neighbours, '),\n",

Now danced lusty Venus\\' children dear: For in the Fish their lady sat full And looked on them with a friendly eye.  This noble king is set upon his throne; This strange knight is fetched to him full sone, And on the dance he goes with Canace. Here is the revel and the jollity, That is not able a dull man to devise: He must have knowen love and his service, And been a feastly man, as fresh as May, That shoulde you devise such array. Who coulde telle you the form of dances So uncouth, and so freshe countenances Such subtle lookings and dissimulances, For dread of jealous men\\'s apperceivings?

The steward bids the spices for to hie And eke the wine, in all this melody; The ushers and the squiers be y-gone, The spices and the wine is come anon; They eat and drink, and when this hath an end, Unto the temple, as reason was, they wend; The service done, they suppen all by day What needeth you rehearse their array?

Such wond\\'ring was there on this horse of brass, That, since the great siege of Troye was, There as men wonder\\'d on a horse also, Ne\\'er was there such a wond\\'ring as was tho. But finally the king asked the knight The virtue of this courser, and the might, And prayed him to tell his governance.

Of his diet measurable was he, For it was of no superfluity, But of great nourishing, and digestible. His study was but little on the Bible. In sanguine and in perse he clad was all Lined with taffeta, and with sendall. And yet he was but easy of dispense: He kept that he won in the pestilence. For gold in physic is a cordial; Therefore he loved gold in special. \\t A good WIFE was there OF beside BATH, But she was somedeal deaf, and that was scath. Of cloth-making she hadde such an haunt, She passed them of Ypres, and of Gaunt.  In all the parish wife was there none, That to the off'ring before her should gon, And if there did, certain so wroth was she, That she was out of alle charity Her coverchiefs were full fine of ground I durste swear, they weighede ten pound  That on the Sunday were upon her head. Her hosen weren of fine scarlet red, Full strait y-tied, and shoes full moist and new Bold was her face, and fair and red of hue. She was a worthy woman all her live, Husbands at the church door had she had five, Withouten other company in youth; But thereof needeth not to speak as nouth. And thrice had she been at Jerusalem; She hadde passed many a strange stream At Rome she had been, and at Bologne, In Galice at Saint James,  and at Cologne; She coude much of wand'rng by the Way. Gat-toothed was she, soothly for to say. Upon an ambler easily she sat, Y-wimpled well, and on her head an hat As broad as is a buckler or a targe. A foot-mantle about her hippes large, And on her feet a pair of spurres sharp. In fellowship well could she laugh and carp Of remedies of love she knew perchance For of that art she coud the olde dance. \\t A good man there was of religion, That was a poore PARSON of a town: But rich he was of holy thought and werk. He was also a learned man, a clerk, That Christe's gospel truly woulde preach. His parishens devoutly would he teach. Benign he was, and wonder diligent, And in adversity full patient: And such he was y-proved often sithes. Full loth were him to curse for his tithes, But rather would he given out of doubt, Unto his poore parishens about, Of his off'ring, and eke of his substance. He could in little thing have suffisance. Wide was his parish, and houses far asunder, But he ne left not, for no rain nor thunder, In sickness and in mischief to visit The farthest in his parish, much and lit, Upon his feet, and in his hand a staff. This noble ensample to his sheep he gaf, That first he wrought, and afterward he taught. Out of the gospel he the wordes caught, And this figure he added yet thereto, That if gold ruste, what should iron do? For if a priest be foul, on whom we trust, No wonder is a lewed man to rust: And shame it is, if that a priest take keep, To see a shitten shepherd and clean sheep: Well ought a priest ensample for to give, By his own cleanness, how his sheep should live. He sette not his benefice to hire, And left his sheep eucumber'd in the mire, And ran unto London, unto Saint Paul's, To seeke him a chantery for souls, Or with a brotherhood to be withold: But dwelt at home, and kepte well his fold, So that the wolf ne made it not miscarry. He was a shepherd, and no mercenary. And though he holy were, and virtuous, He was to sinful men not dispitous Nor of his speeche dangerous nor dign But in his teaching discreet and benign. To drawen folk to heaven, with fairness, By good ensample, was his business: But it were any person obstinate, What so he were of high or low estate, Him would he snibbe sharply for the nones. A better priest I trow that nowhere none is. He waited after no pomp nor reverence, Nor maked him a spiced conscience, But Christe's lore, and his apostles' twelve, He taught, and first he follow'd it himselve. \\t With him there was a PLOUGHMAN, was his brother, That had y-laid of dung full many a fother. A true swinker and a good was he, Living in peace and perfect charity. God loved he beste with all his heart At alle times, were it gain or smart, And then his neighebour right as himselve.

For though the signe shewed a delay, Yet wist he well that granted was his boon; And with glad heart he went him home full soon. \\t The third hour unequal  Began to Venus\\' temple for to gon, Up rose the sun, and up rose Emily, And to the temple of Dian gan hie. Her maidens, that she thither with her lad, Th\\' incense, the clothes, and the remnant all That to the sacrifice belonge shall, The hornes full of mead, as was the guise; There lacked nought to do her sacrifice. Smoking the temple full of clothes fair, This Emily with hearte debonnair Her body wash\\'d with water of a well. But how she did her rite I dare not tell; But it be any thing in general; And yet it were a game to hearen all To him that meaneth well it were no charge: But it is good a man to be at large. Her bright hair combed was, untressed all. A coronet of green oak cerriall  Upon her head was set full fair and meet. Two fires on the altar gan she bete, And did her thinges, as men may behold In Stace of Thebes , and these bookes old. When kindled was the fire, with piteous cheer Unto Dian she spake as ye may hear. \\t \"O chaste goddess of the woodes green, To whom both heav\\'n and earth and sea is seen, Queen of the realm of Pluto dark and low, Goddess of maidens, that mine heart hast know Full many a year, and wost what I desire, To keep me from the vengeance of thine ire, That Actaeon aboughte cruelly: Chaste goddess, well wottest thou that I Desire to be a maiden all my life, Nor never will I be no love nor wife. I am, thou wost, yet of thy company, A maid, and love hunting and venery, And for to walken in the woodes wild, And not to be a wife, and be with child. Nought will I know the company of man. Now help me, lady, since ye may and can, For those three formes  that thou hast in thee. And Palamon, that hath such love to me, And eke Arcite, that loveth me so sore, This grace I pray thee withoute more, As sende love and peace betwixt them two: And from me turn away their heartes so, That all their hote love, and their desire, And all their busy torment, and their fire, Be queint, or turn\\'d into another place. And if so be thou wilt do me no grace, Or if my destiny be shapen so That I shall needes have one of them two, So send me him that most desireth me. Behold, goddess of cleane chastity, The bitter tears that on my cheekes fall. Since thou art maid, and keeper of us all, My maidenhead thou keep and well conserve, And, while I live, a maid I will thee serve. \\t The fires burn upon the altar clear, While Emily was thus in her prayere: But suddenly she saw a sighte quaint. For right anon one of the fire\\'s queint And quick\\'d again, and after that anon That other fire was queint, and all agone: And as it queint, it made a whisteling, As doth a brande wet in its burning. And at the brandes end outran anon As it were bloody droppes many one: For which so sore aghast was Emily, That she was well-nigh mad, and gan to cry, For she ne wiste what it signified; But onely for feare thus she cried, And wept, that it was pity for to hear. And therewithal Diana gan appear With bow in hand, right as an hunteress, And saide; \"Daughter, stint thine heaviness. Among the goddes high it is affirm\\'d, And by eternal word writ and confirm\\'d, Thou shalt be wedded unto one of tho That have for thee so muche care and woe: But unto which of them I may not tell. Farewell, for here I may no longer dwell. The fires which that on mine altar brenn, Shall thee declaren, ere that thou go henne, Thine aventure of love, as in this case.\" And with that word, the arrows in the case Of the goddess did clatter fast and ring, And forth she went, and made a vanishing, For which this Emily astonied was, And saide; \"What amounteth this, alas! I put me under thy protection, Diane, and in thy disposition.\" And home she went anon the nexte way. This is th\\' effect, there is no more to say. \\t The nexte hour of Mars following this Arcite to the temple walked is Of fierce Mars, to do his sacrifice With all the rites of his pagan guise. With piteous heart and high devotion Right thus to Mars he said his orison \"O stronge god, that in the regnes old Of Thrace honoured art, and lord y-hold And hast in every regne, and every land Of armes all the bridle in thine hand, And them fortunest as thee list devise, Accept of me my piteous sacrifice. If so be that my youthe may deserve, And that my might be worthy for to serve Thy godhead, that I may be one of thine, Then pray I thee to rue upon my pine, For thilke pain, and thilke hote fire, In which thou whilom burned\\'st for desire Whenne that thou usedest the beauty Of faire young Venus, fresh and free, And haddest her in armes at thy will: And though thee ones on a time misfill, When Vulcanus had caught thee in his las, And found thee ligging by his wife, alas! For thilke sorrow that was in thine heart, Have ruth as well upon my paine\\'s smart. I am young and unconning, as thou know\\'st, And, as I trow, with love offended most That e\\'er was any living creature: For she, that doth me all this woe endure, Ne recketh ne\\'er whether I sink or fleet And well I wot, ere she me mercy hete, I must with strengthe win her in the place: And well I wot, withoute help or grace Of thee, ne may my strengthe not avail: Then help me, lord, to-morr\\'w in my bataille, For thilke fire that whilom burned thee, As well as this fire that now burneth me; And do that I to-morr\\'w may have victory. Mine be the travail, all thine be the glory. Thy sovereign temple will I most honour Of any place, and alway most labour In thy pleasance and in thy craftes strong. And in thy temple I will my banner hong, And all the armes of my company, And evermore, until that day I die, Eternal fire I will before thee find And eke to this my vow I will me bind: My beard, my hair that hangeth long adown, That never yet hath felt offension Of razor nor of shears, I will thee give, And be thy true servant while I live. Now, lord, have ruth upon my sorrows sore, Give me the victory, I ask no more.\" \\t The prayer stint of Arcita the strong, The ringes on the temple door that hong, And eke the doores, clattered full fast, Of which Arcita somewhat was aghast. The fires burn\\'d upon the altar bright, That it gan all the temple for to light; A sweete smell anon the ground up gaf, And Arcita anon his hand up haf, And more incense into the fire he cast, With other rites more and at the last The statue of Mars began his hauberk ring; And with that sound he heard a murmuring Full low and dim, that saide thus, For which he gave to Mars honour and glory. And thus with joy, and hope well to fare, Arcite anon unto his inn doth fare. As fain as fowl is of the brighte sun. \\t And right anon such strife there is begun For thilke granting, in the heav\\'n above, Betwixte Venus the goddess of love, And Mars the sterne god armipotent, That Jupiter was busy it to stent: Till that the pale Saturnus the cold, That knew so many of adventures old, Found in his old experience such an art, That he full soon hath pleased every part. As sooth is said, eld hath great advantage, In eld is bothe wisdom and usage: Men may the old out-run, but not out-rede. Saturn anon, to stint the strife and drede, Albeit that it is against his kind, Of all this strife gan a remedy find. \"My deare daughter Venus,\" quoth Saturn, \"My course, that hath so wide for to turn, Hath more power than wot any man. Mine is the drowning in the sea so wan; Mine is the prison in the darke cote, Mine the strangling and hanging by the throat, The murmur, and the churlish rebelling, The groyning, and the privy poisoning. I do vengeance and plein correction, I dwell in the sign of the lion. Mine is the ruin of the highe halls, The falling of the towers and the walls Upon the miner or the carpenter: I slew Samson in shaking the pillar: Mine also be the maladies cold, The darke treasons, and the castes old: My looking is the father of pestilence. Now weep no more, I shall do diligence That Palamon, that is thine owen knight, Shall have his lady, as thou hast him hight. Though Mars shall help his knight, yet natheless Betwixte you there must sometime be peace: All be ye not of one complexion, That each day causeth such division, I am thine ayel, ready at thy will; Weep now no more, I shall thy lust fulfil.\" Now will I stenten of the gods above, Of Mars, and of Venus, goddess of love, And telle you as plainly as I can The great effect, for which that I began. \\t Great was the feast in Athens thilke day; And eke the lusty season of that May Made every wight to be in such pleasance, That all that Monday jousten they and dance, And spenden it in Venus\\' high service. But by the cause that they shoulde rise Early a-morrow for to see that fight, Unto their reste wente they at night. And on the morrow, when the day gan spring, Of horse and harness noise and clattering There was in the hostelries all about: And to the palace rode there many a rout Of lordes, upon steedes and palfreys. There mayst thou see devising of harness So uncouth and so rich, and wrought so weel Of goldsmithry, of brouding, and of steel; The shieldes bright, the testers, and trappures Gold-hewen helmets, hauberks, coat-armures; Lordes in parements on their coursers, Knightes of retinue, and eke squiers, Nailing the spears, and helmes buckeling, Gniding of shieldes, with lainers lacing; There as need is, they were nothing idle: The foamy steeds upon the golden bridle Gnawing, and fast the armourers also With file and hammer pricking to and fro; Yeomen on foot, and knaves many one With shorte staves, thick as they may gon; Pipes, trumpets, nakeres, and clariouns, That in the battle blowe bloody souns; The palace full of people up and down, There three, there ten, holding their questioun, Divining of these Theban knightes two. Some saiden thus, some said it shall he so; Some helden with him with the blacke beard, Some with the bald, some with the thick-hair\\'d; Some said he looked grim, and woulde fight: He had a sparth of twenty pound of weight. Thus was the halle full of divining Long after that the sunne gan up spring. The great Theseus that of his sleep is waked With minstrelsy, and noise that was maked, Held yet the chamber of his palace rich, Till that the Theban knightes both y-lich Honoured were, and to the palace fet. Duke Theseus is at a window set, Array\\'d right as he were a god in throne: The people presseth thitherward full soon Him for to see, and do him reverence, And eke to hearken his hest and his sentence. An herald on a scaffold made an O,  Till the noise of the people was y-do: And when he saw the people of noise all still, Thus shewed he the mighty Duke\\'s will. \"The lord hath of his high discretion Considered that it were destruction To gentle blood, to fighten in the guise Of mortal battle now in this emprise: Wherefore to shape that they shall not die, He will his firste purpose modify.

But how the pyre was maked up on height, And eke the names how the trees hight, As oak, fir, birch, asp, alder, holm, poplere, Willow, elm, plane, ash, box, chestnut, lind, laurere, Maple, thorn, beech, hazel, yew, whipul tree, How they were fell\\'d, shall not be told for me; Nor how the goddes rannen up and down Disinherited of their habitatioun, In which they wonned had in rest and peace, Nymphes, Faunes, and Hamadryades; Nor how the beastes and the birdes all Fledden for feare, when the wood gan fall; Nor how the ground aghast was of the light, That was not wont to see the sunne bright; Nor how the fire was couched first with stre, And then with dry stickes cloven in three, And then with greene wood and spicery, And then with cloth of gold and with pierrie, And garlands hanging with full many a flower, The myrrh, the incense with so sweet odour; Nor how Arcita lay among all this, Nor what richess about his body is; Nor how that Emily, as was the guise, Put in the fire of funeral service; Nor how she swooned when she made the fire, Nor what she spake, nor what was her desire; Nor what jewels men in the fire then cast When that the fire was great and burned fast; \\t Nor how some cast their shield, and some their spear, And of their vestiments, which that they wear, And cuppes full of wine, and milk, and blood, Into the fire, that burnt as it were wood; Nor how the Greekes with a huge rout Three times riden all the fire about  Upon the left hand, with a loud shouting, And thries with their speares clattering; And thries how the ladies gan to cry; Nor how that led was homeward Emily; Nor how Arcite is burnt to ashes cold; Nor how the lyke-wake was y-hold All thilke night, nor how the Greekes play The wake-plays, ne keep I not to say: Who wrestled best naked, with oil anoint, Nor who that bare him best in no disjoint. I will not tell eke how they all are gone Home to Athenes when the play is done; But shortly to the point now will I wend, And maken of my longe tale an end. \\t By process and by length of certain years All stinted is the mourning and the tears Of Greekes, by one general assent. Then seemed me there was a parlement At Athens, upon certain points and cas: Amonge the which points y-spoken was To have with certain countries alliance, And have of Thebans full obeisance. For which this noble Theseus anon Let send after the gentle Palamon, Unwist of him what was the cause and why: But in his blacke clothes sorrowfully He came at his commandment on hie; Then sente Theseus for Emily. When they were set, and hush\\'d was all the place And Theseus abided had a space Ere any word came from his wise breast His eyen set he there as was his lest, And with a sad visage he sighed still, And after that right thus he said his will. \"The firste mover of the cause above When he first made the faire chain of love, Great was th\\' effect, and high was his intent; Well wist he why, and what thereof he meant: For with that faire chain of love he bond The fire, the air, the water, and the lond In certain bondes, that they may not flee: That same prince and mover eke,\" quoth he, \"Hath stablish\\'d, in this wretched world adown, Certain of dayes and duration To all that are engender\\'d in this place, Over the whiche day they may not pace, All may they yet their dayes well abridge. There needeth no authority to allege For it is proved by experience; But that me list declare my sentence. Then may men by this order well discern, That thilke mover stable is and etern. Well may men know, but that it be a fool, That every part deriveth from its whole. For nature hath not ta\\'en its beginning Of no partie nor cantle of a thing, But of a thing that perfect is and stable, Descending so, till it be corruptable. And therefore of His wise purveyance He hath so well beset his ordinance, That species of things and progressions Shallen endure by successions, And not etern, withouten any lie: This mayst thou understand and see at eye. Lo th\\' oak, that hath so long a nourishing From the time that it \\'ginneth first to spring, And hath so long a life, as ye may see, Yet at the last y-wasted is the tree. Consider eke, how that the harde stone Under our feet, on which we tread and gon, Yet wasteth, as it lieth by the way. The broade river some time waxeth drey. The greate townes see we wane and wend. Then may ye see that all things have an end. Of man and woman see we well also, -- That needes in one of the termes two, -- That is to say, in youth or else in age,- He must be dead, the king as shall a page; Some in his bed, some in the deepe sea, Some in the large field, as ye may see: There helpeth nought, all go that ilke way: Then may I say that alle thing must die. What maketh this but Jupiter the king? The which is prince, and cause of alle thing, Converting all unto his proper will, From which it is derived, sooth to tell And hereagainst no creature alive, Of no degree, availeth for to strive. Then is it wisdom, as it thinketh me, To make a virtue of necessity, And take it well, that we may not eschew, And namely what to us all is due. And whoso grudgeth ought, he doth folly, And rebel is to him that all may gie. And certainly a man hath most honour To dien in his excellence and flower, When he is sicker of his goode name. Then hath he done his friend, nor him, no shame And gladder ought his friend be of his death, When with honour is yielded up his breath, Than when his name appalled is for age; For all forgotten is his vassalage. Then is it best, as for a worthy fame, To dien when a man is best of name. The contrary of all this is wilfulness. Why grudge we, why have we heaviness, That good Arcite, of chivalry the flower, Departed is, with duty and honour, Out of this foule prison of this life? Why grudge here his cousin and his wife Of his welfare, that loved him so well? Can he them thank? nay, God wot, neverdeal, -- That both his soul and eke themselves offend, And yet they may their lustes not amend. What may I conclude of this longe serie, But after sorrow I rede us to be merry, And thanke Jupiter for all his grace? And ere that we departe from this place, I rede that we make of sorrows two One perfect joye lasting evermo\\': And look now where most sorrow is herein, There will I first amenden and begin. \"Sister,\" quoth he, \"this is my full assent, With all th\\' advice here of my parlement, That gentle Palamon, your owen knight, That serveth you with will, and heart, and might, And ever hath, since first time ye him knew, That ye shall of your grace upon him rue, And take him for your husband and your lord: Lend me your hand, for this is our accord. Let see now of your womanly pity. He is a kinge\\'s brother\\'s son, pardie. And though he were a poore bachelere, Since he hath served you so many a year, And had for you so great adversity, It muste be considered, \\'lieveth me. For gentle mercy oweth to passen right.\" Then said he thus to Palamon the knight; \"I trow there needeth little sermoning To make you assente to this thing. Come near, and take your lady by the hand.\" Betwixte them was made anon the band, That hight matrimony or marriage, By all the counsel of the baronage. And thus with alle bliss and melody Hath Palamon y-wedded Emily. And God, that all this wide world hath wrought, Send him his love, that hath it dearly bought. For now is Palamon in all his weal, Living in bliss, in riches, and in heal. And Emily him loves so tenderly, And he her serveth all so gentilly, That never was there worde them between Of jealousy, nor of none other teen. Thus endeth Palamon and Emily And God save all this faire company. \\t'),\n",

She thanked him, and with full great humbless She saide; \"Sir, since of your gentleness Ye proffer me to have so large a reign, Ne woulde God never betwixt us twain, As in my guilt, were either war or strife: Sir, I will be your humble true wife, Have here my troth, till that my hearte brest.\" Thus be they both in quiet and in rest. \\t For one thing, Sires, safely dare I say, That friends ever each other must obey, If they will longe hold in company. Love will not be constrain\\'d by mastery. When mast\\'ry comes, the god of love anon Beateth  his wings, and, farewell, he is gone. Love is a thing as any spirit free. Women of kind desire liberty, And not to be constrained as a thrall, And so do men, if soothly I say shall. Look who that is most patient in love, He is at his advantage all above. Patience is a high virtue certain, For it vanquisheth, as these clerkes sayn, Thinges that rigour never should attain. For every word men may not chide or plain. Learne to suffer, or, so may I go, Ye shall it learn whether ye will or no. For in this world certain no wight there is, That he not doth or saith sometimes amiss. Ire, or sickness, or constellation, Wine, woe, or changing of complexion, Causeth full oft to do amiss or speaken: On every wrong a man may not be wreaken. After the time must be temperance To every wight that can of governance. And therefore hath this worthy wise knight (To live in ease) sufferance her behight; And she to him full wisly gan to swear That never should there be default in her. Here may men see a humble wife accord; Thus hath she ta\\'en her servant and her lord, Servant in love, and lord in marriage. Then was he both in lordship and servage? Servage? nay, but in lordship all above, Since he had both his lady and his love: His lady certes, and his wife also, The which that law of love accordeth to. And when he was in this prosperrity, Home with his wife he went to his country, Not far from Penmark, where his dwelling was, And there he liv\\'d in bliss and in solace. Who coulde tell, but he had wedded be, The joy, the ease, and the prosperity, That is betwixt a husband and his wife? A year and more lasted this blissful life, Till that this knight, of whom I spake thus, That of Cairrud  was call\\'d Arviragus, Shope him to go and dwell a year or twain In Engleland, that call\\'d was eke Britain, To seek in armes worship and honour (For all his lust he set in such labour); And dwelled there two years; the book saith thus. \\t Now will I stint of this Arviragus, And speak I will of Dorigen his wife, That lov\\'d her husband as her hearte\\'s life.

He kept his law to which he was y-sworn, And thereto he was hardy, wise, and rich, And piteous and just, always y-lich; True of his word, benign and honourable; Of his corage as any centre stable; Young, fresh, and strong, in armes desirous As any bachelor of all his house. A fair person he was, and fortunate, And kept alway so well his royal estate, That there was nowhere such another man. This noble king, this Tartar Cambuscan, Hadde two sons by Elfeta his wife, Of which the eldest highte Algarsife, The other was y-called Camballo. A daughter had this worthy king also, That youngest was, and highte Canace: But for to telle you all her beauty, It lies not in my tongue, nor my conning; I dare not undertake so high a thing: Mine English eke is insufficient, It muste be a rhetor excellent, That couth his colours longing for that art, If he should her describen any part; I am none such, I must speak as I can. \\t And so befell, that when this Cambuscan Had twenty winters borne his diadem, As he was wont from year to year, I deem, He let the feast of his nativity Do crye, throughout Sarra his city, The last Idus of March, after the year. Phoebus the sun full jolly was and clear, For he was nigh his exaltation In Marte's face, and in his mansion  In Aries, the choleric hot sign: Full lusty was the weather and benign; For which the fowls against the sunne sheen, What for the season and the younge green, Full loude sange their affections: Them seemed to have got protections Against the sword of winter keen and cold. This Cambuscan, of which I have you told, In royal vesture, sat upon his dais, With diadem, full high in his palace; And held his feast so solemn and so rich, That in this worlde was there none it lich.

I will not tarry you, for it is prime, And for it is no fruit, but loss of time; Unto my purpose I will have recourse. And so befell that, after the third course, While that this king sat thus in his nobley, Hearing his ministreles their thinges play Before him at his board deliciously, In at the halle door all suddenly There came a knight upon a steed of brass, And in his hand a broad mirror of glass; Upon his thumb he had of gold a ring, And by his side a naked sword hanging: And up he rode unto the highe board. In all the hall was there not spoke a word, For marvel of this knight; him to behold Full busily they waited, young and old. \\t This strange knight, that came thus suddenly, All armed, save his head, full richely, Saluted king, and queen, and lordes all, By order as they satten in the hall, With so high\"),\n",

This orison must eke be said with great humbleness and full pure, and honestly, and not to the annoyance of any man or woman. It must eke be continued with the works of charity. It availeth against the vices of the soul; for, assaith Saint Jerome, by fasting be saved the vices of the flesh, and by prayer the vices of the soul \\t After this thou shalt understand, that bodily pain stands in waking [watching]. ye enter not into temptation.\" Ye shall understand also, that fasting stands in three things: in forbearing of bodily meat and drink, and in forbearing of worldly jollity, and in forbearing of deadly sin; this is to say, that a man shall keep him from deadly sin in all that he may. And thou shalt understand eke, that God ordained fasting; and to fasting appertain four things: largeness [generosity] to poor folk; gladness of heart spiritual; not to be angry nor annoyed nor grudge [murmur] for he fasteth; and also reasonable hour for to eat by measure; that is to say, a man should not eat in untime [out of time], meal for [because] he fasteth. Then shalt thou understand, that bodily pain standeth in discipline, or teaching, by word, or by writing, or by ensample. Also in wearing of hairs [haircloth] or of stamin [coarse hempen cloth], or of habergeons [mail-shirts]  on their naked flesh for Christ\\'s sake; but ware thee well that such manner penance of thy flesh make not thine heart bitter or angry, nor annoyed of thyself; for better is to cast away thine hair than to cast away the sweetness of our Lord Jesus Christ. And therefore saith Saint Paul, \"Clothe you, as they that be chosen of God in heart, of misericorde [with compassion], debonairte [gentleness], sufferance [patience], and such manner of clothing,\" of which Jesus Christ is more apaid [better pleased] than of hairs or of hauberks. Then is discipline eke in knocking of thy breast, in scourging with yards [rods], in kneelings, in tribulations, in suffering patiently wrongs that be done to him, and eke in patient sufferance of maladies, or losing of worldly catel [chattels], or of wife, or of child, or of other friends. \\t Then shalt thou understand which things disturb penance, and this is in four things; that is dread, shame, hope, and wanhope, that is, desperation. And for to speak first of dread, for which he weeneth that he may suffer no penance, thereagainst is remedy for to think that bodily penance is but short and little at the regard of [in comparison with] the pain of hell, that is so cruel and so long, that it lasteth without end. Now against the shame that a man hath to shrive him, and namely [specially] these hypocrites, that would be holden so perfect, that they have no need to shrive them; against that shame should a man think, that by way of reason he that hath not been ashamed to do foul things, certes he ought not to be ashamed to do fair things, and that is confession. A man should eke think, that God seeth and knoweth all thy thoughts, and all thy works; to him may nothing be hid nor covered. Men should eke remember them of the shame that is to come at the day of doom, to them that be not penitent and shriven in this present life; for all the creatures in heaven, and in earth, and in hell, shall see apertly [openly] all that he hideth in this world. \\t Now for to speak of them that be so negligent and slow to shrive them; that stands in two manners. The one is, that he hopeth to live long, and to purchase [acquire] much riches for his delight, and then he will shrive him: and, as he sayeth, he may, as him seemeth, timely enough come to shrift: another is, the surquedrie [presumption ] that he hath in Christ\\'s mercy. Against the first vice, he shall think that our life is in no sickerness, [security] and eke that all the riches in this world be in adventure, and pass as a shadow on the wall; and, as saith St Gregory, that it appertaineth to the great righteousness of God, that never shall the pain stint [cease] of them, that never would withdraw them from sin, their thanks [with their goodwill], but aye continue in sin; for that perpetual will to do sin shall they have perpetual pain. Wanhope [despair] is in two manners [of two kinds]. The first wanhope is, in the mercy of God: the other is, that they think they might not long persevere in goodness. The first wanhope cometh of that he deemeth that he sinned so highly and so oft, and so long hath lain in sin, that he shall not be saved. Certes against that cursed wanhope should he think, that the passion of Jesus Christ is more strong for to unbind, than sin is strong for to bind. Against the second wanhope he shall think, that as oft as he falleth, he may arise again by penitence; and though he never so long hath lain in sin, the mercy of Christ is always ready to receive him to mercy. Against the wanhope that he thinketh he should not long persevere in goodness, he shall think that the feebleness of the devil may nothing do, but [unless] men will suffer him; and eke he shall have strength of the help of God, and of all Holy Church, and of the protection of angels, if him list. \\t Then shall men understand, what is the fruit of penance; and after the word of Jesus Christ, it is the endless bliss of heaven, where joy hath no contrariety of woe nor of penance nor grievance; there all harms be passed of this present life; there as is the sickerness [security] from the pain of hell; there as is the blissful company, that rejoice them evermore each of the other\\'s joy; there as the body of man, that whilom was foul and dark, is more clear than the sun; there as the body of man that whilom was sick and frail, feeble and mortal, is immortal, and so strong and so whole, that there may nothing apair [impair, injure] it; there is neither hunger, nor thirst, nor cold, but every soul replenished with the sight of the perfect knowing of God. This blissful regne [kingdom] may men purchase by poverty spiritual, and the glory by lowliness, the plenty of joy by hunger and thirst, the rest by travail, and the life by death and mortification of sin; to which life He us bring, that bought us with his precious blood!

For ye, that be so glorious in honours, Shall not ally you to no hazardours, As by my will, nor as by my treaty.\" This wise philosopher thus said he. Look eke how to the King Demetrius The King of Parthes, as the book saith us, Sent him a pair of dice of gold in scorn, For he had used hazard therebeforn: For which he held his glory and renown At no value or reputatioun.

Lo, rather he forbiddeth such swearing, Than homicide, or many a cursed thing; I say that as by order thus it standeth; This knoweth he that his hests understandeth, How that the second hest of God is that.

A surgeon, by licence and assent of such as were wise, up rose, and to Meliboeus said as ye may hear. do to every wight the best that we can, where as we be withholden, [employed] and to our patient that we do no damage; wherefore it happeneth many a time and oft, that when two men have wounded each other, one same surgeon healeth them both; wherefore unto our art it is not pertinent to nurse war, nor parties to support [take sides]. warishing [healing] of your daughter, albeit so that perilously she be wounded, we shall do so attentive business from day to night, that, with the grace of God, she shall be whole and sound, as soon as is possible.\" Almost right in the same wise the physicians answered, save that they said a few words more: that right as maladies be cured by their contraries, right so shall man warish war (by peace). His neighbours full of envy, his feigned friends that seemed reconciled, and his flatterers, made semblance of weeping, and impaired and agregged [aggravated] much of this matter, in praising greatly Meliboeus of might, of power, of riches, and of friends, despising the power of his adversaries: and said utterly, that he anon should wreak him on his foes, and begin war. \\t Up rose then an advocate that was wise, by leave and by counsel of other that were wise, and said, \"Lordings, the need [business] for which we be assembled in this place, is a full heavy thing, and an high matter, because of the wrong and of the wickedness that hath been done, and eke by reason of the great damages that in time coming be possible to fall for the same cause, and eke by reason of the great riches and power of the parties both; for which reasons, it were a full great peril to err in this matter. Wherefore, Meliboeus, this is our sentence [opinion]; we counsel you, above all things, that right anon thou do thy diligence in keeping of thy body, in such a wise that thou want no espy counsel that in thine house thou set sufficient garrison, so that they may as well thy body as thy house defend. But, certes, to move war or suddenly to do vengeance, we may not deem [judge] in so little time that it were profitable. Wherefore we ask leisure and space to have deliberation in this case to deem; for the common proverb saith thus; \\'He that soon deemeth soon shall repent.\\' And eke men say, that that judge is wise, that soon understandeth a matter, and judgeth by leisure. For albeit so that all tarrying be annoying, algates [nevertheless] it is no reproof [subject for reproach] in giving of judgement, nor in vengeance taking, when it is sufficient and, reasonable. that shewed our Lord Jesus Christ by example; for when that the woman that was taken in adultery was brought in his presence to know what should be done with her person, albeit that he wist well himself what he would answer, yet would he not answer suddenly, but he would have deliberation, and in the ground he wrote twice. And by these causes we ask deliberation and we shall then by the grace of God counsel the thing that shall be profitable.\" \\t Up started then the young folk anon at once, and the most part of that company have scorned these old wise men and begun to make noise and said, \"Right as while that iron is hot men should smite, right so men should wreak their wrongs while that they be fresh and new:\" Up rose then one of these old wise, and with his hand made countenance [a sign, gesture] that men should hold them still, and give him audience. \"Lordings,\" quoth he, \"there is full many a man that crieth, \\'War! war!\\' that wot full little what war amounteth. so large, that every wight may enter when him liketh, and lightly [easily] find war: but certes what end shall fall thereof it is not light to know.

       "  'Our sweet Lord God of Heaven, that no man will perish, but will that we come all to the knowledge of him, and to the blissful life that is perdurable [everlasting], admonishes us by the prophet Jeremiah, that saith in this wise: \"Stand upon the ways, and see and ask of old paths, that is to say, of old sentences, which is the good way, and walk in that way, and ye shall find refreshing for your souls,\"  &c. spiritual ways that lead folk to our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the reign of glory; of which ways there is a full noble way, and full convenable, which may not fail to man nor to woman, that through sin hath misgone from the right way of Jerusalem celestial; and this way is called penitence. Of which men should gladly hearken and inquire with all their hearts, to wit what is penitence, and whence it is called penitence, and in what manner, and in how many manners, be the actions or workings of penitence, and how many species there be of penitences, and what things appertain and behove to penitence, and what things disturb penitence. \\t [Penitence is described, on the authority of Saints Ambrose, Isidore, and Gregory, as the bewailing of sin that has been wrought, with the purpose never again to do that thing, or any other thing which a man should bewail; for weeping and not ceasing to do the sin will not avail -- though it is to be hoped that after every time that a man falls, be it ever so often, he may find grace to arise through penitence. And repentant folk that leave their sin ere sin leave them, are accounted by Holy Church sure of their salvation, even though the repentance be at the last hour. There are three actions of penitence; that a man be baptized after he has sinned; that he do no deadly sin after receiving baptism; and that he fall into no venial sins from day to day. \"Thereof saith St Augustine, that penitence of good and humble folk is the penitence of every day.\" The species of penitence are three: solemn, when a man is openly expelled from Holy Church in Lent, or is compelled by Holy Church to do open penance for an open sin openly talked of in the country; common penance, enjoined by priests in certain cases, as to go on pilgrimage naked or barefoot; and privy penance, which men do daily for private sins, of which they confess privately and receive private penance. To very perfect penitence are behoveful and necessary three things: contrition of heart, confession of mouth, and satisfaction; which are fruitful penitence against delight in thinking, reckless speech, and wicked sinful works. \\t Penitence may be likened to a tree, having its root in contrition, biding itself in the heart as a tree-root does in the earth; out of this root springs a stalk, that bears branches and leaves of confession, and fruit of satisfaction. Of this root also springs a seed of grace, which is mother of all security, and this seed is eager and hot; and the grace of this seed springs of God, through remembrance on the day of judgment and on the pains of hell. The heat of this seed is the love of God, and the desire of everlasting joy; and this heat draws the heart of man to God, and makes him hate his sin. Penance is the tree of life to them that receive it. In penance or contrition man shall understand four things: what is contrition; what are the causes that move a man to contrition; how he should be contrite; and what contrition availeth to the soul. Contrition is the heavy and grievous sorrow that a man receiveth in his heart for his sins, with earnest purpose to confess and do penance, and never more to sin. Six causes ought to move a man to contrition: 1. He should remember him of his sins; 2. He should reflect that sin putteth a man in great thraldom, and all the greater the higher is the estate from which he falls; 3. He should dread the day of doom and the horrible pains of hell; 4. The sorrowful remembrance of the good deeds that here on earth, and also the good that he hath lost, ought to make him have contrition; 5. So also ought the remembrance of the passion that our Lord Jesus Christ suffered for our sins; 6. And so ought the hope of three things, that is to say, forgiveness of sin, the gift of grace to do well, and the glory of heaven with which God shall reward man for his good deeds. -- All these points the Parson illustrates and enforces at length; waxing especially eloquent under the third head, and plainly setting forth the sternly realistic notions regarding future punishments that were entertained in the time of Chaucer:-]  \\t Certes, all the sorrow that a man might make from the beginning of the world, is but a little thing, at retard of [in comparison with] the sorrow of hell. The cause why that Job calleth hell the land of darkness;  understand, that he calleth it land or earth, for it is stable and never shall fail, and dark, for he that is in hell hath default [is devoid] of light natural; for certes the dark light, that shall come out of the fire that ever shall burn, shall turn them all to pain that be in hell, for it sheweth them the horrible devils that them torment. Covered with the darkness of death; that is to say, that he that is in hell shall have default of the sight of God; for certes the sight of God is the life perdurable [everlasting]. The darkness of death, be the sins that the wretched man hath done, which that disturb [prevent] him to see the face of God, right as a dark cloud doth between us and the sun. Land of misease, because there be three manner of defaults against three things that folk of this world have in this present life; that is to say, honours, delights, and riches. Against honour have they in hell shame and confusion: for well ye wot, that men call honour the reverence that man doth to man; but in hell is no honour nor reverence; for certes no more reverence shall be done there to a king than to a knave [servant]. For which God saith by the prophet Jeremiah; \"The folk that me despise shall be in despite.\" Honour is also called great lordship. There shall no wight serve other, but of harm and torment. Honour is also called great dignity and highness; but in hell shall they be all fortrodden [trampled under foot] of devils. As God saith, \"The horrible devils shall go '),\n",

Solomon saith, \\'Where as thou mayest have no audience, enforce thee not to speak.\\' \"I \"that the common proverb is sooth, that good counsel wanteth, when it is most need.\" Yet [besides, further] had this Meliboeus in his council many folk, that privily in his ear counselled him certain thing, and counselled him the contrary in general audience. When Meliboeus had heard that the greatest part of his council were accorded [in agreement] that he should make war, anon he consented to their counselling, and fully affirmed their sentence [opinion, judgement]. \\t (Dame Prudence, seeing her husband\\'s resolution thus taken, in full humble wise, when she saw her time, begins to counsel him against war, by a warning against haste in requital of either good or evil. counsel, because he should be held a fool if he rejected for her advice the opinion of so many wise men; because all women are bad; because it would seem that he had given her the mastery over him; and because she could not keep his secret, if he resolved to follow her advice. To these reasons Prudence answers that it is no folly to change counsel when things, or men\\'s judgements of them, change -- especially to alter a resolution taken on the impulse of a great multitude of folk, where every man crieth and clattereth what him liketh; that if all women had been wicked, Jesus Christ would never have descended to be born of a woman, nor have showed himself first to a woman after his resurrection and that when Solomon said he had found no good woman, he meant that God alone was supremely good;  that her husband would not seem to give her the mastery by following her counsel, for he had his own free choice in following or rejecting it; and that he knew well and had often tested her great silence, patience, and secrecy. And whereas he had quoted a saying, that in wicked counsel women vanquish men, she reminds him that she would counsel him against doing a wickedness on which he had set his mind, and cites instances to show that many women have been and yet are full good, and their counsel wholesome and profitable. Lastly, she quotes the words of God himself, when he was about to make woman as an help meet for man; and promises that, if her husband will trust her counsel, she will restore to him his daughter whole and sound, and make him have honour in this case. wife\\'s sweet words, and also because he has proved and assayed her great wisdom and her great truth, he will govern him by her counsel in all things. Thus encouraged, Prudence enters on a long discourse, full of learned citations, regarding the manner in which counsellors should be chosen and consulted, and the times and reasons for changing a counsel. First, God must be besought for guidance. Then a man must well examine his own thoughts, of such things as he holds to be best for his own profit; driving out of his heart anger, covetousness, and hastiness, which perturb and pervert the judgement. Then he must keep his counsel secret, unless confiding it to another shall be more profitable; but, in so confiding it, he shall say nothing to bias the mind of the counsellor toward flattery or subserviency. After that he should consider his friends and his enemies, choosing of the former such as be most faithful and wise, and eldest and most approved in counselling; and even of these only a few. Then he must eschew the counselling of fools, of flatterers, of his old enemies that be reconciled, of servants who bear him great reverence and fear, of folk that be drunken and can hide no counsel, of such as counsel one thing privily and the contrary openly; and of young folk, for their counselling is not ripe. Then, in examining his counsel, he must truly tell his tale; he must consider whether the thing he proposes to do be reasonable, within his power, and acceptable to the'),\n",

Also, very shrift [true confession] asketh certain free will, not constrained, nor for shame of folk, nor for malady [sickness], trespasseth by his free will, that by his free will he confess his trespass; and that no other man tell his sin but himself; nor he shall not nay nor deny his sin, nor wrath him against the priest for admonishing him to leave his sin. The second condition is, that thy shrift be lawful, that is to say, that thou that shrivest thee, and eke the priest that heareth thy confession, be verily in the faith of Holy Church, and that a man be not despaired of the mercy of Jesus Christ, as Cain and Judas were. And eke a man must accuse himself of his own trespass, and not another: but he shall blame and wite [accuse] himself of his own malice and of his sin, and none other: but nevertheless, if that another man be occasion or else enticer of his sin, or the estate of the person be such by which his sin is aggravated, or else that be may not plainly shrive him but [unless] he tell the person with which he hath sinned, then may he tell, so that his intent be not to backbite the person, but only to declare his confession. Thou shalt not eke make no leasings [falsehoods] in thy confession for humility, peradventure, to say that thou hast committed and done such sins of which that thou wert never guilty. For Saint Augustine saith, \"If that thou, because of humility, makest a leasing on thyself, though thou were not in sin before, yet art thou then in sin through thy leasing.\" Thou must also shew thy sin by thine own proper mouth, but [unless] thou be dumb, and not by letter; for thou that hast done the sin, thou shalt have the shame of the confession. Thou shalt not paint thy confession with fair and subtle words, to cover the more thy sin; for then beguilest thou thyself, and not the priest; thou must tell it plainly, be it never so foul nor so horrible. Thou shalt eke shrive thee to a priest that is discreet to counsel thee; and eke thou shalt not shrive thee for vain-glory, nor for hypocrisy, nor for no cause but only for the doubt [fear] of Jesus\\' Christ and the health of thy soul. Thou shalt not run to the priest all suddenly, to tell him lightly thy sin, as who telleth a jape [jest] or a tale, but advisedly and with good devotion; and generally shrive thee oft; if thou oft fall, oft arise by confession. And though thou shrive thee oftener than once of sin of which thou hast been shriven, it is more merit; and, as saith Saint Augustine, thou shalt have the more lightly [easily] release and grace of God, both of sin and of pain. And certes, once a year at the least way, it is lawful to be houseled,  for soothly once a year all things in the earth renovelen [renew themselves]. \\t [Here ends the Second Part of the Treatise; the Third Part, which contains the practical application of the whole, follows entire, along with the remarkable \"Prayer of Chaucer,\" as it stands in the Harleian Manuscript:--] \\t De Tertia Parte Poenitentiae. [Of the third part of penitence] \\t Now have I told you of very [true] confession, that is the second part of penitence: The third part of penitence is satisfaction, and that standeth generally in almsdeed and bodily pain. Now be there three manner of almsdeed: contrition of heart, where a man offereth himself to God; the second is, to have pity of the default of his neighbour; the third is, in giving of good counsel and comfort, ghostly and bodily, where men have need, and namely [specially] sustenance of man\\'s food. And take keep [heed] that a man hath need of these things generally; he hath need of food, of clothing, and of herberow [lodging], he hath need of charitable counsel and visiting in prison and malady, and sepulture of his dead body. And if thou mayest not visit the needful with thy person, visit them by thy message and by thy gifts. These be generally alms or works of charity of them that have temporal riches or discretion in counselling. Of these works shalt thou hear at the day of doom. This alms shouldest thou do of thine own proper things, and hastily [promptly], and privily [secretly] if thou mayest; but nevertheless, if thou mayest not do it privily, thou shalt not forbear to do alms, though men see it, so that it be not done for thank of the world, but only for thank of Jesus Christ. For, as witnesseth Saint Matthew, chap. v., \"A city may not be hid that is set on a mountain, nor men light not a lantern and put it under a bushel, but men set it on a candlestick, to light the men in the house; right so shall your light lighten before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father that is in heaven.\" \\t Now as to speak of bodily pain, it is in prayer, in wakings, [watchings] in fastings, and in virtuous teachings. Of orisons ye shall understand, that orisons or prayers is to say a piteous will of heart, that redresseth it in God, and expresseth it by word outward, to remove harms, and to have things spiritual and durable, and sometimes temporal things. Of which orisons, certes in the orison of the Pater noster hath our Lord Jesus Christ enclosed most things. Certes, it is privileged of three things in its dignity, for which it is more digne [worthy] than any other prayer: for Jesus Christ himself made it: and it is short, for [in order] it should be coude the more lightly, [be more easily conned or learned] and to withhold [retain] it the more easy in heart, and help himself the oftener with this orison; and for a man should be the less weary to say it; and for a man may not excuse him to learn it, it is so short and so easy: and for it comprehendeth in itself all good prayers. The exposition of this holy prayer, that is so excellent and so digne, I betake [commit] to these masters of theology; save thus much will I say, when thou prayest that God should forgive thee thy guilts, as thou forgivest them that they guilt to thee, be full well ware that thou be not out of charity.

But peradventure he hath such heaviness and such wrath to usward, [towards us] because of our offence, that he will enjoin us such a pain [penalty] as we may not bear nor sustain; and therefore, noble lady, we beseech to your womanly pity to take such advisement [consideration] in this need, that we, nor our friends, be not disinherited and destroyed through our folly.\" \\t \"Certes,\" quoth Prudence, \"it is an hard thing, and right perilous, that a man put him all utterly in the arbitration and judgement and in the might and power of his enemy. For Solomon saith, \\'Believe me, and give credence to that that I shall say: to thy son, to thy wife, to thy friend, nor to thy brother, give thou never might nor mastery over thy body, while thou livest.\\' should not give to his brother, nor to his friend, the might of his body, by a stronger reason he defendeth and forbiddeth a man to give himself to his enemy. And nevertheless, I counsel you that ye mistrust not my lord: for I wot well and know verily, that he is debonair and meek, large, courteous and nothing desirous nor envious of good nor riches: for there is nothing in this world that he desireth save only worship and honour. Furthermore I know well, and am right sure, that he shall nothing do in this need without counsel of me; and I shall so work in this case, that by the grace of our Lord God ye shall be reconciled unto us.\" \\t Then said they with one voice, \"\"Worshipful lady, we put us and our goods all fully in your will and disposition, and be ready to come, what day that it like unto your nobleness to limit us or assign us, for to make our obligation and bond, as strong as it liketh unto your goodness, that we may fulfil the will of you and of my lord Meliboeus.\" \\t When Dame Prudence had heard the answer of these men, she bade them go again privily, and she returned to her lord Meliboeus, and told him how she found his adversaries full repentant, acknowledging full lowly their sins and trespasses, and how they were ready to suffer all pain, requiring and praying him of mercy and pity. Then said Meliboeus, \"He is well worthy to have pardon and forgiveness of'),\n",

To which Meliboeus answered, and said; \"Certes,\" quoth he, \"I think and purpose me fully to disinherit them of all that ever they have, and for to put them in exile for evermore.\" \"Certes,\" quoth Dame Prudence, \"this were a cruel sentence, and much against reason. For ye be rich enough, and have no need of other men\\'s goods; and ye might lightly [easily] in this wise get you a covetous name, which is a vicious thing, and ought to be eschewed of every good man: for, after the saying of the Apostle, covetousness is root of all harms. And therefore it were better for you to lose much good of your own, than for to take of their good in this manner. For better it is to lose good with worship [honour], than to win good with villainy and shame. And every man ought to do his diligence and his business to get him a good name. And yet [further] shall he not only busy him in keeping his good name, but he shall also enforce him alway to do some thing by which he may renew his good name; for it is written, that the old good los [reputation ] of a man is soon gone and passed, when it is not renewed. that ye will exile your adversaries, that thinketh ye much against reason, and out of measure, [moderation] considered the power that they have given you upon themselves. And it is written, that he is worthy to lose his privilege, that misuseth the might and the power that is given him. might enjoin them that pain by right and by law (which I trow ye may not do), I say, ye might not put it to execution peradventure, and then it were like to return to the war, as it was before. ye must deem [decide] more courteously, that is to say, ye must give more easy sentences and judgements. For it is written, \\'He that most courteously commandeth, to him men most obey.\\' And therefore I pray you, that in this necessity and in this need ye cast you [endeavour, devise a way] to overcome your heart. For Seneca saith, that he that overcometh his heart, overcometh twice. And Tullius saith, \\'There is nothing so commendable in a great lord, as when he is debonair and meek, and appeaseth him lightly [easily].\\' And I pray you, that ye will now forbear to do vengeance, in such a manner, that your good name may be kept and conserved, and that men may have cause and matter to praise you of pity and of mercy; and that ye have no cause to repent you of thing that ye do. For Seneca saith, \\'He overcometh in an evil manner, that repenteth him of his victory.\\' Wherefore I pray you let mercy be in your heart, to the effect and intent that God Almighty have mercy upon you in his last judgement; for Saint James saith in his Epistle, \\'Judgement without mercy shall be done to him, that hath no mercy of another wight.\\'\" \\t When Meliboeus had heard the great skills [arguments, reasons] and reasons of Dame Prudence, and her wise information and teaching, his heart gan incline to the will of his wife, considering her true intent, he conformed him anon and assented fully to work after her counsel, and thanked God, of whom proceedeth all goodness and all virtue, that him sent a wife of so great discretion. And when the day came that his adversaries should appear in his presence, he spake to them full goodly, and said in this wise; \"Albeit so, that of your pride and high presumption and folly, an of your negligence and unconning, [ignorance] ye have misborne [misbehaved] you, and trespassed [done injury] unto me, yet forasmuch as I see and behold your great humility, and that ye be sorry and repentant of your guilts, it constraineth me to do you grace and mercy. Wherefore I receive you into my grace, and forgive you utterly all the offences, injuries, and wrongs, that ye have done against me and mine, to this effect and to this end, that God of his endless mercy will at the time of our dying forgive us our guilts, that we have trespassed to him in this wretched world; for doubtless, if we be sorry and repentant of the sins and guilts which we have trespassed in the sight of our Lord God, he is so free and so merciable [merciful], that he will forgive us our guilts, and bring us to the bliss that never hath end.\" Amen. \\t'),\n",

Lastly, of what contrition availeth, the Parson says, that sometimes it delivereth man from sin; that without it neither confession nor satisfaction is of any worth; that it \"destroyeth the prison of hell, and maketh weak and feeble all the strengths of the devils, and restoreth the gifts of the Holy Ghost and of all good virtues, and cleanseth the soul of sin, and delivereth it from the pain of hell, and from the company of the devil, and from the servage [slavery] of sin, and restoreth it to all goods spiritual, and to the company and communion of Holy Church.\" He who should set his intent to these things, would no longer be inclined to sin, but would give his heart and body to the service of Jesus Christ, and thereof do him homage. \"For, certes, our Lord Jesus Christ hath spared us so benignly in our follies, that if he had not pity on man\\'s soul, a sorry song might we all sing.\" \\t The Second Part of the Parson\\'s Tale or Treatise opens with an explanation of what is confession -- which is termed \"the second part of penitence, that is, sign of contrition;\" whether it ought needs be done or not; and what things be convenable to true confession. Confession is true shewing of sins to the priest, without excusing, hiding, or forwrapping [disguising] of anything, and without vaunting of good works. \"Also, it is necessary to understand whence that sins spring, and how they increase, and which they be.\" From Adam we took original sin; \"from him fleshly descended be we all, and engendered of vile and corrupt matter;\" and the penalty of Adam\\'s transgression dwelleth with us as to temptation, which penalty is called concupiscence. \"This concupiscence, when it is wrongfully disposed or ordained in a man, it maketh him covet, by covetise of flesh, fleshly sin by sight of his eyes, as to earthly things, and also covetise of highness by pride of heart.\" The Parson proceeds to shew how man is tempted in his flesh to sin; how, after his natural concupiscence, comes suggestion of the devil, that is to say the devil\\'s bellows, with which he bloweth in man the fire of con cupiscence; and how man then bethinketh him whether he will do or no the thing to which he is tempted. If he flame up into pleasure at the thought, and give way, then is he all dead in soul; \"and thus is sin accomplished, by temptation, by delight, and by consenting; and then is the sin actual.\" Sin is either venial, or deadly; deadly, when a man loves any creature more than Jesus Christ our Creator, venial, if he love Jesus Christ less than he ought. Venial sins diminish man\\'s love to God more and more, and may in this wise skip into deadly sin; for many small make a great. \"And hearken this example: A great wave of the sea cometh sometimes with so great a violence, that it drencheth [causes to sink] the ship: and the same harm do sometimes the small drops, of water that enter through a little crevice in the thurrok [hold, bilge], and in the bottom of the ship, if men be so negligent that they discharge them not betimes. And therefore, although there be difference betwixt these two causes of drenching, algates [in any case] the ship is dreint [sunk]. Right so fareth it sometimes of deadly sin,\" and of venial sins when they multiply in a man so greatly as to make him love worldly things more than God. The Parson then enumerates specially a number of sins which many a man peradventure deems no sins, and confesses them not, and yet nevertheless they are truly sins: -- ] \\t This is to say, at every time that a man eateth and drinketh more than sufficeth to the sustenance of his body, in certain he doth sin; eke when he speaketh more than it needeth, he doth sin; eke when he heareth not benignly the complaint of the poor; eke when he is in health of body, and will not fast when other folk fast, without cause reasonable; eke when he sleepeth more than needeth, or when he cometh by that occasion too late to church, or to other works of charity; eke when he useth his wife without sovereign desire of engendrure, to the honour of God, or for the intent to yield his wife his debt of his body; eke when he will not visit the sick, or the prisoner, if he may; eke if he love wife, or child, or other worldly thing, more than reason requireth; eke if he flatter or blandish more than he ought for any necessity; eke if he minish or withdraw the alms of the poor; eke if he apparail [prepare] his meat more deliciously than need is, or eat it too hastily by likerousness [gluttony]; church, or at God\\'s service, or that he be a talker of idle words of folly or villainy, for he shall yield account of them at the day of doom; eke when he behighteth [promiseth] or assureth to do things that he may not perform; eke when that by lightness of folly he missayeth or scorneth his neighbour; eke when he hath any wicked suspicion of thing, that he wot of it no soothfastness: these things, and more without number, be sins, as saith Saint Augustine. \\t [No earthly man may eschew all venial sins; yet may he refrain him, by the burning love that he hath to our Lord Jesus Christ, and by prayer and confession, and other good works, so that it shall but little grieve. \"Furthermore, men may also refrain and put away venial sin, by receiving worthily the precious body of Jesus Christ; by receiving eke of holy wat'),\n",

       "  ' estate and luxury, shall receive the malison [condemnation] that Christ shall give at the day of doom to them that shall be damned: (6.) Gluttony; -- of which the Parson treats so briefly that the chapter may be given in full: -- ] \\t After Avarice cometh Gluttony, which is express against the commandment of God. Gluttony is unmeasurable appetite to eat or to drink; or else to do in aught to the unmeasurable appetite and disordered covetousness [craving] to eat or drink. This sin corrupted all this world, as is well shewed in the sin of Adam and of Eve. Look also what saith Saint Paul of gluttony: \"Many,\" saith he, \"go, of which I have oft said to you, and now I say it weeping, that they be enemies of the cross of Christ, of which the end is death, and of which their womb [stomach] is their God and their glory;\" in confusion of them that so savour [take delight in] earthly things. He that is usant [accustomed, addicted] to this sin of gluttony, he may no sin withstand, he must be in servage [bondage] of all vices, hoard, [lair, lurking-place] where he hideth him in and resteth. This sin hath many species. The first is drunkenness, that is the horrible sepulture of man\\'s reason: and therefore when a man is drunken, he hath lost his reason; and this is deadly sin. But soothly, when that a man is not wont to strong drink, and peradventure knoweth not the strength of the drink, or hath feebleness in his head, or hath travailed [laboured], through which he drinketh the more, all [although] be he suddenly caught with drink, it is no deadly sin, but venial. The second species of gluttony is, that the spirit of a man waxeth all troubled for drunkenness, and bereaveth a man the discretion of his wit. The third species of gluttony is, when a man devoureth his meat, and hath no rightful manner of eating. The fourth is, when, through the great abundance of his meat, the humours of his body be distempered. The fifth is, forgetfulness by too much drinking, for which a man sometimes forgetteth by the morrow what be did at eve. In other manner be distinct the species of gluttony, after Saint Gregory. The first is, for to eat or drink before time. The second is, when a man getteth him too delicate meat or drink. The third is, when men take too much over measure [immoderately]. The fourth is curiosity [nicety] with great intent [application, pains] to make and apparel [prepare] his meat. The fifth is, for to eat too greedily. These be the five fingers of the devil\\'s hand, by which he draweth folk to the sin. \\t Against gluttony the remedy is abstinence, as saith Galen; but that I hold not meritorious, if he do it only for the health of his body. Saint Augustine will that abstinence be done for virtue, and with patience. Abstinence, saith he, is little worth, but [unless] a man have good will thereto, and but it be enforced by patience and by charity, and that men do it for God\\'s sake, and in hope to have the bliss in heaven. The fellows of abstinence be temperance, that holdeth the mean in all things; also shame, that escheweth all dishonesty [indecency, impropriety], sufficiency, that seeketh no rich meats nor drinks, nor doth no force of [sets no value on] no outrageous apparelling of meat; measure [moderation] also, that restraineth by reason the unmeasurable appetite of eating; soberness also, that restraineth the outrage of drink; sparing also, that restraineth the delicate ease to sit long at meat, wherefore some folk stand of their own will to eat, because they will eat at less leisure. \\t [At great length the Parson then points out the many varieties of the sin of (7.) Lechery, and its remedy in chastity and continence, alike in marriage and in widowhood; also in the abstaining from all such indulgences of eating, drinking, and sleeping as inflame the passions, and from the company of all who may tempt to the sin. Minute guidance is given as to the duty of confessing fully and faithfully the circumstances that attend and may aggravate this sin; and the Treatise then passes to the consideration of the conditions that are essential to a true and profitable confession of sin in general. First, it must be in sorrowful bitterness of spirit; a condition that has five signs -- shamefastness, humility in heart and outward sign, weeping with the bodily eyes or in the heart, disregard of the shame that might curtail or garble confession, and obedience to the penance enjoined. Secondly, true confession must be promptly made, for dread of death, of increase of sinfulness, of forgetfulness of what should be confessed, of Christ\\'s refusal to hear if it be put off to the last day of life; and this condition has four terms; that confession be well pondered beforehand, that the man confessing have comprehended in his mind the number and greatness of his sins and how long he has lain in sin, that he be contrite for and eschew his sins, and that he fear and flee the occasions for that sin to which he is inclined. -- What follows under this head is of some interest for the light which it throws on the rigorous government wielded by the Romish Church in those days --] \\t Also thou shalt shrive thee of all thy sins to one man, and not a parcel [portion] to one man, and a parcel to another; that is to understand, in intent to depart [divide] thy confession for shame or dread; for it is but strangling of thy soul. For certes Jesus Christ is entirely all good, in him is none imperfection, and therefore either he forgiveth all perfectly, or else never a deal [not at all]. I say not that if thou be assigned to thy penitencer  for a certain sin, that thou art bound to shew him all the remnant of thy sins, of which thou hast been shriven of thy curate, but if it like thee [unless thou be pleased] of thy humility; this is no departing [division] of shrift. And I say not, where I speak of division of confession, that if thou have license to shrive thee to a discreet and an honest priest, and where thee liketh, and by the license of thy curate, that thou mayest not well shrive thee to him of all thy sins: but let no blot be behind, let no sin be untold as far as thou hast remembrance.

And when Meliboeus\\' friends had taken their advice and deliberation of the foresaid matter, and had examined it by great business and great diligence, they gave full counsel for to have peace and rest, and that Meliboeus should with good heart receive his adversaries to forgiveness and mercy.

And when these trespassers and repenting folk of their follies, that is to say, the adversaries of Meliboeus, had heard what these messengers said unto them, they were right glad and joyful, and answered full meekly and benignly, yielding graces and thanks to their lord Meliboeus, and to all his company; and shaped them without delay to go with the messengers, and obey to the commandment of their lord Meliboeus. they took their way to the court of Meliboeus, and took with them some of their true friends, to make faith for them, and for to be their borrows [sureties]. \\t And when they were come to the presence of Meliboeus, he said to them these words; \"It stands thus,\" quoth Meliboeus, \"and sooth it is, that ye causeless, and without skill and reason, have done great injuries and wrongs to me, and to my wife Prudence, and to my daughter also; for ye have entered into my house by violence, and have done such outrage, that all men know well that ye have deserved the death: and therefore will I know and weet of you, whether ye will put the punishing and chastising, and the vengeance of this outrage, in the will of me and of my wife, or ye will not?\" Then the wisest of them three answered for them all, and said; \"Sir,\" quoth he, \"we know well, that we be I unworthy to come to the court of so great a lord and so worthy as ye be, for we have so greatly mistaken us, and have offended and aguilt [incurred guilt] in such wise against your high lordship, that truly we have deserved the death.

Pride itself springs sometimes of the goods of nature, sometimes of the goods of fortune, sometimes of the goods of grace; but the Parson, enumerating and examining all these in turn, points out how little security they possess and how little ground for pride they furnish, and goes on to enforce the remedy against pride -- which is humility or meekness, a virtue through which a man hath true knowledge of himself, and holdeth no high esteem of himself in regard of his deserts, considering ever his frailty.] \\t Now be there three manners [kinds] of humility; as humility in heart, and another in the mouth, and the third in works. The humility in the heart is in four manners: the one is, when a man holdeth himself as nought worth before God of heaven; the second is, when he despiseth no other man; the third is, when he recketh not though men hold him nought worth; the fourth is, when he is not sorry of his humiliation. Also the humility of mouth is in four things: in temperate speech; in humility of speech; and when he confesseth with his own mouth that he is such as he thinketh that he is in his heart; another is, when he praiseth the bounte [goodness] of another man and nothing thereof diminisheth. Humility eke in works is in four manners: the first is, when he putteth other men before him; the second is, to choose the lowest place of all; the third is, gladly to assent to good counsel; the fourth is, to stand gladly by the award [judgment] of his sovereign, or of him that is higher in degree: certain this is a great work of humility. \\t [The Parson proceeds to treat of the other cardinal sins, and their remedies: (2.) Envy, with its remedy, the love of God principally and of our neighbours as ourselves: (3.) Anger, with all its fruits in revenge, rancour, hate, discord, manslaughter, blasphemy, swearing, falsehood, flattery, chiding and reproving, scorning, treachery, sowing of strife, doubleness of tongue, betraying of counsel to a man\\'s disgrace, menacing, idle words, jangling, japery or buffoonery, &c. -- and its remedy in the virtues called mansuetude, debonairte, or gentleness, and patience or sufferance: (4.) Sloth, or \"Accidie,\" which comes after the sin of Anger, because Envy blinds the eyes of a man, and Anger troubleth a man, and Sloth maketh him heavy, thoughtful, and peevish. It is opposed to every estate of man -- as unfallen, and held to work in praising and adoring God; as sinful, and held to labour in praying for deliverance from sin; and as in the state of grace, and held to works of penitence. It resembles the heavy and sluggish condition of those in hell; it will suffer no hardness and no penance; it prevents any beginning of good works; it causes despair of God\\'s mercy, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost; it induces somnolency and neglect of communion in prayer with God; and it breeds negligence or recklessness, that cares for nothing, and is the nurse of all mischiefs, if ignorance is their mother. Against Sloth, and these and other branches and fruits of it, the remedy lies in the virtue of fortitude or strength, in its various species of magnanimity or great courage; faith and hope in God and his saints; surety or sickerness, when a man fears nothing that can oppose the good works he has under taken; magnificence, when he carries out great works of goodness begun; constancy or stableness of heart; and other incentives to energy and laborious service: (5.) Avarice, or Covetousness, which is the root of all harms, since its votaries are idolaters, oppressors and enslavers of men, deceivers of their equals in business, simoniacs, gamblers, liars, thieves, false swearers, blasphemers, murderers, and sacrilegious. Its remedy lies in compassion and pity largely exercised, and in reasonable liberality -- for those who spend on \"fool-largesse,\" or ostentation of worldly'),\n",

Now be they called chieftains, forasmuch as they be chief, and of them spring all other sins. The root of these sins, then, is pride, the general root of all harms. For of this root spring certain branches: as ire, envy, accidie  or sloth, avarice or covetousness (to common understanding), gluttony, and lechery: and each of these sins hath his branches and his twigs, as shall be declared in their chapters following. And though so be, that no man can tell utterly the number of the twigs, and of the harms that come of pride, yet will I shew a part of them, as ye shall understand. There is inobedience, vaunting, hypocrisy, despite, arrogance, impudence, swelling of hearte, insolence, elation, impatience, strife, contumacy, presumption, irreverence, pertinacity, vain- glory and many another twig that I cannot tell nor declare. . . .] \\t And yet [moreover] there is a privy species of pride that waiteth first to be saluted ere he will salute, all [although] be he less worthy than that other is; and eke he waiteth [expecteth] or desireth to sit or to go above him in the way, or kiss the pax,  or be incensed, or go to offering before his neighbour, and such semblable [like] things, against his duty peradventure, but that he hath his heart and his intent in such a proud desire to be magnified and honoured before the people. Now be there two manner of prides; the one of them is within the heart of a man, and the other is without. Of which soothly these foresaid things, and more than I have said, appertain to pride that is within the heart of a man and there be other species of pride that be without: but nevertheless, the one of these species of pride is sign of the other, right as the gay levesell [bush] at the tavern is sign of the wine that is in the cellar. And this is in many things: as in speech and countenance, and outrageous array of clothing; for certes, if there had been no sin in clothing, Christ would not so soon have noted and spoken of the clothing of that rich man in the gospel. And Saint Gregory saith, that precious clothing is culpable for the dearth [dearness] of it, and for its softness, and for its strangeness and disguising, and for the superfluity or for the inordinate scantness of it; alas! may not a man see in our days the sinful costly array of clothing, and namely [specially] in too much superfluity, or else in too disordinate scantness? As to the first sin, in superfluity of clothing, which that maketh it so dear, to the harm of the people, not only the cost of the embroidering, the disguising, indenting or barring, ounding, paling,  winding, or banding, and semblable [similar] waste of cloth in vanity; but there is also the costly furring [lining or edging with fur] in their gowns, so much punching of chisels to make holes, so much dagging [cutting] of shears, with the superfluity in length of the foresaid gowns, trailing in the dung and in the mire, on horse and eke on foot, as well of man as of woman, that all that trailing is verily (as in effect) wasted, consumed, threadbare, and rotten with dung, rather than it is given to the poor, to great damage of the foresaid poor folk, and that in sundry wise: this is to say, the more that cloth is wasted, the more must it cost to the poor people for the scarceness; and furthermore, if so be that they would give such punched and dagged clothing to the poor people, it is not convenient to wear for their estate, nor sufficient to boot [help, remedy] their necessity, to keep them from the distemperance [inclemency] of the firmament. Upon the other side, to speak of the horrible disordinate scantness of clothing, as be these cutted slops or hanselines [breeches] , that through their shortness cover not the shameful member of man, to wicked intent alas! some of them shew the boss and the shape of the horrible swollen members, that seem like to the malady of hernia, in the wrapping of their hosen, and eke the buttocks of them, that fare as it were the hinder part of a she-ape in the full of the moon. And more over the wretched swollen members that they shew through disguising, in departing [dividing] of their hosen in white and red, seemeth that half their shameful privy members were flain [flayed]. And if so be that they depart their hosen in other colours, as is white and blue, or white and black, or black and red, and so forth; then seemeth it, by variance of colour, that the half part of their privy members be corrupt by the fire of Saint Anthony, or by canker, or other such mischance. And of the hinder part of their buttocks it is full horrible to see, for certes, in that part of their body where they purge their stinking ordure, that foul part shew they to the people proudly in despite of honesty [decency], which honesty Jesus Christ and his friends observed to shew in his life. Now as of the outrageous array of women, God wot, that though the visages of some of them seem full chaste and debonair [gentle], yet notify they, in their array of attire, likerousness and pride. I say not that honesty [reasonable and appropriate style] in clothing of man or woman unconvenable but, certes, the superfluity or disordinate scarcity of clothing is reprovable. Also the sin of their ornament, or of apparel, as in things that appertain to riding, as in too many delicate horses, that be holden for delight, that be so fair, fat, and costly; and also in many a vicious knave, [servant] that is sustained because of them; in curious harness, as in saddles, cruppers, peytrels, [breast-plates] and bridles, covered with precious cloth and rich bars and plates of gold and silver. For which God saith by Zechariah the prophet, \"I will confound the riders of such horses.\" These folk take little regard of the riding of God\\'s Son of heaven, and of his harness, when he rode upon an ass, and had no '),\n",

As to changing his counsel, a man may do so without reproach, if the cause cease, or when a new case betides, or if he find that by error or otherwise harm or damage may result, or if his counsel be dishonest or come of dishonest cause, or if it be impossible or may not properly be kept; and he must take it for a general rule, that every counsel which is affirmed so strongly, that it may not be changed for any condition that may betide, that counsel is wicked. Meliboeus, admitting that his wife had spoken well and suitably as to counsellors and counsel in general, prays her to tell him in especial what she thinks of the counsellors whom they have chosen in their present need. Prudence replies that his counsel in this case could not properly be called a counselling, but a movement of folly; and points out that he has erred in sundry wise against the rules which he had just laid down. Granting that he has erred, Meliboeus says that he is all ready to change his counsel right as she will devise; for, as the proverb runs, to do sin is human, but to persevere long in sin is work of the Devil. Prudence then minutely recites, analyses, and criticises the counsel given to her husband in the assembly of his friends. She commends the advice of the physicians and surgeons, and urges that they should be well rewarded for their noble speech and their services in healing Sophia; and she asks Meliboeus how he understands their proposition that one contrary must be cured by another contrary. Meliboeus answers, that he should do vengeance on his enemies, who had done him wrong. Prudence, however, insists that vengeance is not the contrary of vengeance, nor wrong of wrong, but the like; and that wickedness should be healed by goodness, discord by accord, war by peace. lawyers and wise folk that advised Meliboeus to take prudent measures for the security of his body and of his house. First, she would have her husband pray for the protection and aid of Christ; then commit the keeping of his person to his true friends; then suspect and avoid all strange folk, and liars, and such people as she had already warned him against; then beware of presuming on his strength, or the weakness of his adversary, and neglecting to guard his person -- for every wise man dreadeth his enemy; then he should evermore be on the watch against ambush and all espial, even in what seems a place of safety; though he should not be so cowardly, as to fear where is no cause for dread; yet he should dread to be poisoned, and therefore shun scorners, and fly their words as venom. the fortification of his house, she points out that towers and great edifices are costly and laborious, yet useless unless defended by true friends that be old and wise; and the greatest and strongest garrison that a rich man may have, as well to keep his person as his goods, is, that he be beloved by his subjects and by his neighbours. Warmly approving the counsel that in all this business Meliboeus should proceed with great diligence and deliberation, Prudence goes on to examine the advice given by his neighbours that do him reverence without love, his old enemies reconciled, his flatterers that counselled him certain things privily and openly counselled him the contrary, and the young folk that counselled him to avenge himself and make war at once. powerful enemies, whose kindred are numerous and close, while his are fewer and remote in relationship; that only the judge who has jurisdiction in a case may take sudden vengeance on any man; that her husband's power does not accord with his desire; and that, if he did take vengeance, it would only breed fresh wrongs and contests.

Meliboeus demurs, that if his wife\\'s objections prevailed, vengeance would never be taken, and thence great mischiefs would arise; but Prudence replies that the taking of vengeance lies with the judges, to whom the private individual must have recourse. vengeance does not please him, and that, as Fortune has nourished and helped him from his childhood, he will now assay her, trusting, with God\\'s help, that she will aid him to avenge his shame. Prudence warns him against trusting to Fortune, all the less because she has hitherto favoured him, for just on that account she is the more likely to fail him; and she calls on him to leave his vengeance with the Sovereign Judge, that avengeth all villainies and wrongs. Meliboeus argues that if he refrains from taking vengeance he will invite his enemies to do him further wrong, and he will be put and held over low; but Prudence contends that such a result can be brought about only by the neglect of the judges, not by the patience of the individual. repeats that he is not strong enough, and quotes the common saw, that it is madness for a man to strive with a stronger than himself, peril to strive with one of equal strength, and folly to strive with a weaker. But, considering his own defaults and demerits, -- remembering the patience of Christ and the undeserved tribulations of the saints, the brevity of this life with all its trouble and sorrow, the discredit thrown on the wisdom and training of he should refrain wholly from taking vengeance. Meliboeus submits that he is not at all a perfect man, and his heart will never be at peace until he is avenged; and that as his enemies disregarded the peril when they attacked him, so he might, without reproach, incur some peril in attacking them in return, even though he did a great excess in avenging one wrong by another. Prudence strongly deprecates all outrage or excess; but Meliboeus insists that he cannot see that it might greatly harm him though he took a vengeance, for he is richer and mightier than his enemies, and all things obey money. Prudence thereupon launches into a long dissertation on the advantages of riches, the evils of poverty, the means by which wealth should be gathered, and the manner in which it should be used; and concludes by counselling her husband not to move war and battle through trust in his riches, for they suffice not to maintain war, the battle is not always to the strong or the numerous, and the perils of conflict are many. Meliboeus then curtly asks her for her counsel how he shall do in this need; and she answers that certainly she counsels him to agree with his adversaries and have peace with them. Meliboeus on this cries out that plainly she loves not his honour or his worship, in counselling him to go and humble himself before his enemies, crying mercy to them that, having done him so grievous wrong, ask him not to be reconciled. Then Prudence, making semblance of wrath, retorts that she loves his honour and profit as she loves her own, and ever has done; she cites the Scriptures in support of her counsel to seek peace; and says she will leave him to his own courses, for she knows well he is so stubborn, that he will do nothing for her. Meliboeus then relents; admits that he is angry and cannot judge aright; and puts himself wholly in her hands, promising to do just as she desires, and admitting that he is the more held to love and praise her, if she reproves him of his folly) \\t Then Dame Prudence discovered all her counsel and her will unto him, and said: \"I counsel you,\" quoth she, \"above all things, that ye make peace between God and you, and be reconciled unto Him and to his grace; for, as I have said to you herebefore, God hath suffered you to have this tribulation and disease [distress, trouble] for your sins; and if ye do as I say you, God will send your adversaries unto you, and make them'),\n",
